The court said that the woman's statements had ""inherent contradictions"".
New Delhi:
It takes one's lifetime to build a reputation, but a few lies can destroy it, said a Delhi court while acquitting a man of rape charge and directing initiation of perjury proceedings against the woman for filing a false case.
Additional Sessions Judge Anuj Agrawal was hearing the case against the man, who was accused of raping the complainant in a hotel here on the intervening night of November 23-24, 2019.
""It is evident from record that prosecutrix gave false deposition before this court and concocted a mendacious story of rape/threat,"" the court said in its verdict dated April 4 and acquitted the accused.
The court noted that the woman had filed six similar rape and molestation cases in past against different persons and according to Delhi Police she was ""in habit of giving false complaint of molestation and eve-teasing"".
The court said that her statements had ""inherent contradictions"".
Noting the facts of the case, the judge said, ""The said circumstances, if seen cumulatively, unerringly lead to only one inference that victim entrapped accused in a preplanned manner, which further stands fortified in light of testimony of defence witnesses 1 and 2, who categorically deposed that victim had made a demand of Rs seven lakhs for stating in favour of accused so that he can be released on bail. There are no palpable reasons to disbelieve the version of defence witnesses."" The additional sessions judge said the courts acted as ""healers to administer panacea of justice to the wounds of the aggrieved"" instead of merely adjudicating upon the aspects of guilt or innocence.
""The word 'aggrieved' cannot be confined only to complainants, but there may be cases where even the accused become the real sufferer, standing before the court with folded hands and beseeching justice for themselves,"" he said.
The judge said that a simple acquittal could not recompense the agony of the accused, who had to undergo the ""trauma of trial"" for the heinous offence of rape and criminal intimidation based on a false story.
""It takes one's lifetime to build a reputation but only few lies to destroy the same,"" the judge said, directing initiation of perjury proceedings against the woman.

The court has awarded compensation of Rs 19.5 lakh to the victim for her rehabilitation.
New Delhi:
Delhi's Tis Hazari Court on Thursday sentenced a man to life imprisonment for raping and impregnating a minor girl. The case was registered under the POCSO Act at Nihal Vihar Police Station in 2024.
The convict, a neighbour of the victim, was someone she trusted and referred to as 'uncle.' The child born from the assault has since been placed for adoption.
""The convict did not care that the victim used to call him 'uncle' or that she was his neighbour's daughter. In our Indian culture, when parents go somewhere, they ask their neighbours to take care of their children. The convict has betrayed and breached that trust,"" the court said in the order.
Special Judge (POCSO) Babita Puniya sentenced the convict to life imprisonment (for the remainder of his life) under section 6 of the POCSO Act. The Judge remarked, ""In my considered view, the convict's conduct has rendered this offence more serious.""
""For the offence punishable under section 6 of POCSO, he (Convict) is sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life and to pay a fine of Rs. 10,000,"" the court ordered on March 10.
The court had convicted the accused on January 30, 2025, for the offence punishable under sections 5 (j) (ii) & (l) read with section 6 of the POCSO Act and section 376 (2) (n)/506 Part II IPC. No separate sentence for section 376 (Rape) has been awarded by the court.
The court observed, ""The victim was an innocent, helpless 'child', who was sexually assaulted by her neighbour whom she used to call 'Uncle'; he abused his position of trust which he had as a neighbour in the life of the victim.""
The court has awarded compensation of Rs 19.5 lakh to the victim for her rehabilitation under the victim compensation scheme.
The prosecution had prayed for the strictest and severest sentence to be awarded to the convict. Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) prayed that argued that the convict repeatedly raped the girl, but throughout the trial he denied his complicity in the crime and at no point of time did he show any remorse for his horrific act.
""Thus, according to learned Prosecutor, he should not be allowed back into the society keeping in view the interest of society which demands that wanton criminal acts as displayed by the convict should be punished proportionately,"" the court noted the submissions of SPP.
On the other hand, the counsel for the accused prayed for leniency in awarding the punishment. It was submitted that the convict is a young man aged about 35. He is the sole bread earner of his family, which consists of an old mother, a wife, and two minor children. He is illiterate, belongs to the lower strata of society and is a first-time offender without any criminal history.
The court rejected the contention of the defence counsel.

The convict was sentenced to a rigorous jail term of seven years each.
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has sentenced a man to life-term imprisonment in a case of kidnapping and rape of a minor in 2021 and said a clear message had to be sent out that violators of POCSO law will be held accountable.
Additional sessions judge Susheel Bala Dagar heard the case against the 31-year-old convict punished under Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act and IPC for the offences of rape, kidnapping and criminal intimidation.
On the compensation scheme for POCSO survivors, the court said a survivor's suffering had no price tag.
""In any beneficial scheme or legislation, there cannot be a concept of maximum. How can there be a price tag on the suffering of the survivor? No amount of compensation can undo the trauma. The least that can be done to help the survivor is to get his/her life back on track,"" the court said.
The court awarded a Rs 10.5 lakh compensation, saying it would assist in the survivor's rehabilitation.
Additional public prosecutor Yogita Kaushik Dahiya argued the convict deserved no leniency for the reprehensible and despicable act as he kidnapped the girl on by luring her with eatables on July 26, 2021.
Dahiya argued the convict raped the minor while threatening her with a knife. The prosecutor said he was convicted of rape by a court in Uttar Pradesh as well.
In a verdict passed on March 5, the court said, ""A clear message that anyone who violates the POCSO Act will be held accountable for their actions must be sent to society at large by imposing a penalty that is proportionate to the act of sexual assault or sexual harassment. In the present case, the convict is found to be having perverse lust for sex."" It was the society's responsibility, the court said, to protect children from sexual abuse as the psychological scars of such abuse were indelible.
""Taking into consideration the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, including gravity of the offence, the age of the victim and convict, the earlier involvement of the convict in a similar offence, social and economic factors governing them, the convict is sentenced for life imprisonment for the offence under section 6 of the POCSO Act,"" it held.
The convict was further sentenced to a rigorous jail term of seven years each for the offences of kidnapping and criminal intimidation which was directed to run concurrently.

New Delhi:
The Pune rape case - a young woman was raped Tuesday morning, 100 metres from a police station and in a bus in the city's bus Swargate Bus Stand - has led to outrage, with Maharashtra deputy chief ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar demanding death for the accused.
It has also re-ignited conversations around rape laws in India, which were supposed to have been overhauled, and made tougher, after the horrific rape-murder of a woman in Delhi in 2012.
The inhuman and barbaric assault - which included her rapists forcing iron rods into her vagina - was condemned by the United Nations and she was immortalised as 'Nirbhaya', or 'fearless'.
How effective that overhaul, which included changing the definition of the word 'rape' and prescribing a minimum jail term of 20 years for rapists killing or causing their target to be in a ""persistent vegetative state"" - was is unclear. It has not stopped the flood of rapes reported since, including many in which items and substances were forced into women's vaginas.
On the efficacy of the changes in the law, ex-Supreme Court Chief Justice DY Chandrachud weighed in Thursday afternoon, saying, ""A lot of changes were made following the 'Nirbhaya' incident... but we cannot prevent such incidents by just having these laws.""

""There is a great responsibility on society and, apart from this, there should be implementation of these laws. Laws made for women should be implemented properly,"" he said.
""Women should feel safe wherever they go. It is important that in such cases there should be proper investigation, strong action, quick trial and punishment. The legal system and the police have a big responsibility (to make this happen),"" the former Chief Justice stressed.
What 'Nirbhaya's' Mother Said
In December last year, on the 12th anniversary of the Delhi rape case, 'Nirbhaya's' mother lamented the fact women are still largely unsafe across India.
""It is with great pain that I want to say that even after 12 years the circumstances have not changed...The daughters of the country are not safe..."" she said, fighting back tears, at the National Convention on Prevention of Violence Against Women and Children.

""Jo bhi humara kanoon hai uspe sahi mayane mein kaam ho taki humari bacchiyon ko insaaf mile (Whatever laws we have they should be a law in real sense so that our daughters get justice).""
'Nirbhaya's' mother, Asha Devi, led the long and exhausting fight for justice for her daughter (File).
In between the 'Nirbhaya' and Pune bus rapes, there have seen many such barbaric attacks, including the dreadful rape-murder of a junior doctor in Bengal, in Kolkata's RG Kar Hospital, in August last year and the gangrape of 20-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras.
There have also been countless reports of minors being sexually assaulted and killed, often by members of their family, people morally tasked with ensuring their physical and mental safety.
Pune Bus Stand Rape
The alleged rape took place between 5.45 am and 6 am on Tuesday.
The young woman, a domestic, was waiting to board a bus to her hometown in Satara district when she was accosted by the accused, who has been identified as Dattatraya Ramdas Gade, a 36-year-old man with six criminal cases against him and who has been out on bail since 2019.
Gade has been on the run since the rape.

Pune Police, under fire for failing to adequately secure the bus stand, formed 13 special teams to track him down. Earlier today sources told NDTV Gade had been tracked to his hometown.
There are acres of sugarcane fields in that area, and he is believed to be hiding in that vast tract of land. The cops have deployed drones and sniffer dogs to capture him, sources said.
The police have also offered a reward of Rs 1 lakh for Gade's capture.
Apart from the police and the Maharashtra Road Transport Corporation, which operates that bus stand, the state's ruling Mahayuti alliance, led by the BJP, has also been criticised.

Survivors in these cases often require urgent medical intervention, the court noted (File)
New Delhi:
In a landmark order, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed that victims of rape, acid attacks, sexual assaults, and survivors of POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) cases are entitled to free medical treatment at government and private hospitals, as well as nursing homes.
A division bench comprising Justice Prathiba M. Singh and Justice Amit Sharma ruled that all Central and State Government-funded institutions, as well as private hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes, must comply with the directive to ensure that survivors of rape, acid attacks, and POCSO cases receive immediate medical care and necessary services.
The Court clarified that ""treatment"" includes first aid, diagnosis, inpatient care, outpatient follow-ups, diagnostic and laboratory tests, surgeries if needed, physical and mental counselling, psychological support, and family counselling.
The Court noted that a significant number of rape and POCSO cases regularly come before the judiciary. Survivors in these cases often require urgent medical intervention or prolonged medical assistance, including hospital admission, diagnostics, surgical procedures, medications, and counselling services.
Despite existing provisions under the BNSS or CrPC, as well as guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), the Court observed that survivors of sexual violence and acid attacks continue to face challenges in accessing free medical treatment.
The Court issued several key directives, including the circulation of its ruling to all courts dealing with sexual offences, such as POCSO Courts, Criminal Courts, and Family Courts.
The directive aims to ensure that all victims and survivors, in accordance with Section 397 of the BNS (Section 357C of the CrPC), are informed of their legal rights. The Court also mandated that appropriate steps be taken to refer such cases to the relevant medical establishments--whether public, government, or private--whenever courts encounter cases requiring medical assistance for victims or survivors.

accused had been absconding since the registration of the case, Delhi police said.
New Delhi:
Delhi Crime branch team arrested a 25-year-old man involved in a rape case in Badli, Delhi after an extensive 1500 km chase to Surat in Gujarat. The accused had been absconding since the registration of the case, Delhi police said on Thursday.
A process of proclamation was also initiated against the accused in the present case. The accused was apprehended by the NR-I Crime Branch from Surat, Gujarat, after an extensive 1500 km chase.
""The complainant, an employee in Bagwan Pura, had been befriended by the accused while working together. Under the pretext of trust, he administered an intoxicating substance and committed sexual assault while capturing explicit photos and videos. He used these recordings to blackmail the victim, coercing her into further physical relations. The victim courageously reported the matter, leading to the registration of the case at PS SP Badli,"" Delhi police said.
Delhi police said that on December 16 actionable intelligence revealed the accused was hiding in Jai Ambey Nagar, Surat, Gujarat. Acting swiftly, the team conducted a raid and apprehended the accused, bringing him to justice.
The accused, Kuldeep, hails from District Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, and completed his education up to the 8th standard. He has been residing in Bawana, Delhi, for the past 5-6 years and is currently employed as a welder in a factory in the area, Delhi police said.
Police further said that a mobile phone containing explicit videos and photos was used for blackmail and sextortion.

The court underlined material contradictions in the girl's statements. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has acquitted a man in an alleged case of rape of his minor student in 2019 and observed the complainant was in a consensual relationship with him.
Additional sessions judge Ajay Nagar was hearing the case against a tuition teacher against whom the girl, a class 12 student at that time, got a complaint registered alleging she had been repeatedly raped between 2015 and 2018, besides being threatened and forced to watch porn.
The court, however, underlined material contradictions in the girl's statements.
In a 45-page judgement passed on December 5, the court considered the evidence and held, ""Accused is acquitted of all charges..."" Elaborating on the reasons behind its verdict, the court said the prosecution could not prove the complainant was a minor at the time of the alleged offence and therefore the provision for aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence Act could not be invoked.
It noted the complainant's testimony of having looked at a ""vulgar picture inadvertently"" and resiling from her statement that the accused showed her pornographic videos.
""Moreover, the explanation given by the survivor for not disclosing such facts of sexual abuse to her family members or police is not plausible,"" the court said, ""after the alleged rape, the girl did not raise an alarm and instead, she accompanied the accused, who dropped her home"".
Noting her testimony about being ""attracted"" towards the accused and writing him ""love letters"", the court held the girl was having ""a consensual and romantic relationship"" with the accused.
It took note of submissions of defence counsels Nivesh Sharma and Ritu Singh about the complainant wanting to marry the accused, but getting a false rape case registered as he married another woman.
""It is clear from the record that the accused got married to some other woman somewhere in the year 2018 but before the registration of FIR in the present case. No plausible explanation has been given for not making the complaint against the accused for more than three years which clearly shows that it was the case of a consensual and romantic relationship between the accused and the survivor,"" said the court.
The complainant continued with her tuition classes despite the sexual assault, it underscored.
""It is highly improbable that a girl would go to such a place continuously despite the fact that penetrative sexual assaults are repeatedly being committed upon her forcibly,"" the court pointed out.
The verdict further observed the absence of forensic evidence against the accused and held the mere fact that the complainant's hymen was found ruptured, did not prove the offence.
""There is nothing on record to prove the fact that penetrative sexual assaults were committed upon the survivor by the accused except from the testimony of the survivor but it is not reliable, trustworthy and does not inspire the confidence of the court as there are material contradictions,"" the court said.
It said though an accused could be convicted based on the survivor's sole testimony, it had to be of a ""sterling quality"".

Kuldeep Singh Sengar sought interim bail on the grounds that he was suffering from various ailments
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Thursday granted a two-week interim bail on medical grounds to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar who is serving life term for raping a minor in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao in 2017.
A bench headed by Justice Prathiba M Singh suspended the sentence for the time being and directed that Sengar be admitted to AIIMS-Delhi for his medical evaluation and must remain in the capital once discharged.
""Considering the history of the case as also the medical condition of the applicant, it is directed that the applicant will be released on interim bail for two weeks and he shall seek admission in AIIMS Delhi for a comprehensive medical evaluation,"" the bench, also comprising Justice Amit Sharma, said.
The court sought a report from the medical board of AIIMS and listed the matter for hearing on December 20.
Sengar is also serving a 10-year jail term in connection with the custodial death of the Unnao rape victim's father. His plea for interim bail in that case is still pending before another bench of the high court.
Sengar sought interim bail on the grounds that he was suffering from various ailments, like cataract, that required urgent attention.
The plea was opposed by the victim's lawyer as well as the CBI.
Sengar's appeal challenging the trial court's verdict in the main Unnao rape case is pending in the high court.
He has sought quashing of the December 2019 judgement of the trial court which sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.
The girl was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.
On March 13, 2020, Sengar was sentenced to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment and was fined Rs 10 lakh, in connection with the case of custodial death of the rape victim's father. The court had also awarded a 10-year jail term to Sengar's brother Atul Singh Sengar and five others.
The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Sengar in a case under the Arms Act. He died in custody on April 9, 2018.
The rape case and other connected cases were transferred to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1, 2019. PTI ADS VN VN

The two accused men are still at large, the police said. (Representational)
New Delhi:
The Delhi Police has arrested a 23-year-old woman from Ludhiana over her alleged involvement in the rape case of a minor, officials said on Sunday.
The accused was declared a proclaimed offender in the case, which was registered at the Kanjhawala police station here five years ago, they said.
According to a senior police officer, the incident took place in November 2019. The victim, then 15-year-old, was initially reported missing by her family, prompting a search operation.
Upon investigation, it emerged that the minor had been lured by one Geeta. The woman allegedly took the teenager to Surat in Gujarat, where she was allegedly held captive, drugged, and repeatedly raped by two men, said the officer.
The girl's statement was recorded in 2020 after the woman abandoned her in Delhi. She told the police that two men --"" Pintu and Satinder -- allegedly raped her repeatedly for around four months, acting on Geeta's direction.
She claimed the SIM card of her phone was destroyed and she was completely cut off from contacting anyone, the officer said.
Based on the minor's statement, several Indian Penal Code sections 328 (causing hurt by poison to commit an offence), 376D (gang rape), and 120B (criminal conspiracy), along with Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, he said.
Several police teams were formed to catch the accused, but Geeta managed to evade arrest by frequently changing locations.
She was finally caught on Saturday when the police received a tip-off regarding her location in Janta Nagar, Ludhiana in Punjab from where she was arrested.
The two accused men are still at large, the police said.

Court said that the evidence failed to raise significant suspicion about the accused.(Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi Court has recently discharged an accused in a rape case, ruling that the evidence, particularly WhatsApp chats exchanged before and after the alleged incident, contradicted the prosecution's claims.
The case involved allegations of forceful sexual assault made by the complainant, who had been in a consensual relationship with the accused after a marriage proposal was made through a mutual relative.
Advocate Shashank Dewan, representing the accused, submitted that the complainant (prosecutrix) and the accused had been in a consensual sexual relationship, with no commitment to marriage. He further argued that the WhatsApp chats exchanged between the two disproved the allegations of assault, showing no indication of the incident as claimed.
Advocate Dewan contended that the FIR was falsely filed by the complainant to pressure the accused into marriage. Additionally, he pointed out the significant and unexplained delay in the registration of the FIR, which further cast doubt on the veracity of the allegations.
The incident was said to have occurred in November 2020 when the two were returning from shopping. The complainant claimed that the accused assaulted her in a parked car, but filed the case only in April 2021--five months after the alleged incident--raising concerns about the delayed reporting, the court noted.
A key factor in the Court's decision to discharge the accused was the analysis of WhatsApp messages between the complainant and the accused. These messages contradicted the allegations, revealing that the accused had already declined the complainant's marriage proposal and that the complainant had initiated several meetings with him.
The chats from the day of the alleged assault showed cordial relations and no sign of the claimed assault.
Additionally, the complainant admitted to the authenticity of the chats but refused to provide her phone for forensic examination.
The Court concluded that the evidence failed to raise significant suspicion about the accused's involvement in the crime.
The delay in filing the FIR, along with the absence of supporting evidence for the complainant's claims, led the Court to rule that the circumstances of the alleged sexual assault were highly improbable, resulting in the discharge of the accused.

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Friday refused to grant bail to the wife of suspended Delhi government officer Premoday Khakha, who allegedly raped a minor girl several times and impregnated her.
Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma dismissed the bail application of Seema Rani Khakha, saying the case ""strikes at the root of trust between two families"" and the possibility of influencing witnesses can't be ruled out at this stage.
Premoday Khakha has been accused of allegedly raping a minor girl several times between November 2020 and January 2021 and is currently in judicial custody after being arrested in August 2023.
The minor was the daughter of a person known to the accused, according to the police.
The official's wife Seema Rani is also an accused in the case. She allegedly gave the girl medicines to terminate her pregnancy. The woman is in judicial custody.
Delhi Police counsel opposed her bail plea before the high court and argued that she was not a ""passive spectator"" but played an ""active role"" in the crime.
The couple was arrested after the survivor recorded her statement before a magistrate at a hospital.
The case was registered under provisions of the POCSO Act and Indian Penal Code.

""The future of a youngster cannot be ignored by this court at this juncture,"" court said (File)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a young man accused of raping a girl with whom he was having a ""love affair"", while taking note of the ""misapplication"" of law in cases involving boys who are in love with girls on the cusp of adulthood.
The court said this resulted in young boys languishing in jails on account of cases filed at the behest of girls' families objecting to their romantic relationship.
Justice Subramonium Prasad made the observations while dealing with a case in which the victim was 16 years old at the relevant time and the petitioner accused, an adult, was facing allegations of kidnapping and raping the girl.
The high court said consensual sex between girls who are just below the age of 18 years and boys who are just above 20 years is in a ""legal grey area"" because the consent given by a minor girl is not a valid consent in the eyes of law.
""This court has been constantly seeing that Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) cases are being filed at the behest of the girl's family who object to her friendship and romantic involvement with a young boy and the law is being misapplied in such cases which results in young boys, who have genuinely fallen in love with young adolescent girls, languishing in jails,"" the judge said.
The court said it was not going into the question as to whether the petitioner has committed these offences or not and was only concerned with whether a youngster who was in jail for about three years now should be granted bail or not in view of the fact that all public witnesses, including the prosecutrix, have been examined.
In this case, the girl's father had lodged a missing person complaint in November 2021 about his daughter who was subsequently found to be living with the petitioner.
The FIR was lodged for offences of kidnapping, aggravated penetrative sexual assault as well as rape under the Indian Penal Code and the POCSO Act.
The statements given by the girl to the doctors who examined her and to a magistrate showed that she went with the youth of her own accord and that he had not forced himself on her, the court noted.
It noted that the petitioner has been in custody since November 19, 2021 and opined that if he continues to be in jail, the chances of him coming out as a hardened criminal are very high.
""The future of a youngster cannot be ignored by this court at this juncture,"" it said, adding that no useful purpose would be served in keeping him in further custody.
The court granted bail to the petitioner on furnishing a security bond of Rs 50,000 with two sureties of the like amount and imposed certain conditions on him.

Healthcare professionals across the country were protesting over Kolkata rape-murder.(FILE)
New Delhi:
In a major relief for patients, hundreds of resident doctors in Delhi returned to work on Friday after ending their 11-day strike over the alleged rape and murder of a medic in Kolkata, following an appeal by the Supreme Court.
The doctors' association met with Delhi Health Minister Saurabh Bhardwaj in the afternoon at the Secretariat and various issues faced by them.
After the meeting, the minister said he discussed with the doctors the issues they raised and soon, a letter would be sent to the central government regarding these.
Healthcare professionals across the country ceased work after the body of the medic, a junior doctor, was found in a seminar room of the West Bengal government-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on August 9.
Non-emergency services, including OPD and diagnostics, were shut down as medics, including resident doctors, of major central and Delhi government-run hospitals, struck work on August 12 evening, causing hardships for patients and delays in treatment.
Resident doctors, including those of the Centre-run AIIMS, RML Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College and Delhi government-run LNJP, Maulana Azad Medical College, GTB Hospital and Indira Gandhi Hospital, resumed duties after two national bodies announced the end of the strike on Thursday evening.
Dr Ayush Raj, general secretary of the Safdarjung Hospital's Resident Doctors' Association (RDA), said, ""We have resumed work, but we have not stopped fighting for our demands... we are still in silent protest."" He added that all Delhi-based RDA members will decide on a commonplace and day this week to come together for a symbolic protest demanding justice and protection.
Dr Dhruv Chauhan, National Council Member IMA-Junior Doctors Network, said, ""We are in silent protest doing our duties as before but still waiting for justice and the assurances that are given."" ""We have obeyed and respected the decision of the Supreme Court and therefore, resumed our services in the hope that our demands will be fulfilled and our security will be taken as the priority at all levels,"" he added.
The Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) and the Federation of All India Medical Association (FAIMA) decided after the Supreme Court issued directions about the safety of healthcare personnel.
While it appealed to medics across the country to rejoin duty and assured that no coercive action would be taken against them, the top court also said judges and doctors cannot go on a strike since they deal with matters involving life and liberty.
Resident doctor at the GTB Hospital in Delhi, Aman Khanna, said, ""I'm glad to return to work with the hope that our demands will be fulfilled and justice will be served. We are closely observing the decisions the government is making for us."" Except for West Bengal, resident doctors' associations of all other states have called off their strike. In Bengal, the epicentre of the protests, healthcare services remained affected at state-run hospitals as agitating junior doctors have said they would continue their strike.

Governor Bose is likely to meet President Murmu in Delhi on Tuesday.
New Delhi:
West Bengal Governor CV Ananda Bose reached Delhi on Monday night amid speculations that he may meet President Droupadi Murmu and senior leaders.
There have been massive protests in West Bengal and a strike by doctors across the country in the wake of the rape-murder of a woman doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata and allegations of a botched probe and cover-up.  
The governor on Thursday visited the hospital and spoke to the agitating junior doctors, assuring them of justice.
Governor Bose is likely to meet President Murmu in Delhi on Tuesday.
Speaking during a Rakhi celebration programme at Raj Bhavan in Kolkata earlier in the day, where several women doctors and others tied rakhis around his wrists, Mr Bose pledged to support their efforts until the goal of a safer environment for women is achieved.
""In West Bengal, democracy is degenerating. This cannot go on,"" Mr Bose said. He urged collective action to safeguard women, saying, ""Today, we have to take a pledge to protect our daughters, sisters.""
Mr Bose emphasised the need for societal change, stating, ""Our society should become a place where women feel happy and secure. We have failed in our mission to our sisters. This is the minimum a civilised society should do."" ""My responsibility as a governor is to serve the people. I know the goal is far and the road is long, but the march is on. We will certainly reach our destination. I am with you, I am for you,"" Governor Bose said.

Dehradun:
Five people have been arrested in connection with the alleged gang-rape of a teenage girl in a Uttarakhand government bus after it arrived at the bus stand here from Delhi, officials said.
Dehradun Senior Superintendent of Police Ajay Singh said those arrested include the driver and the conductor of the government bus. He said the incident occurred on August 12 at the bus stand here and the police were informed about it Saturday evening.
The police swung into action immediately and identified the roadways bus by scanning CCTV cameras and arrested the five accused, including its driver and the conductor, he said.
The accused have been identified as Dharmendra Kumar (32) and Rajpal (57), both residents of Buggawala in Uttarakhand's Haridwar; Devendra (52), a resident of Bhagwanpur in Haridwar; Rajesh Kumar Sonkar (38), a resident of Patel Nagar here; and Ravi Kumar (34), a resident of Nawabganj in Farrukhabad district of Uttar Pradesh.
He said that Dharmendra Kumar was the driver of the bus used in the incident and Devendra was the conductor. Ravi Kumar and Rajpal are drivers of other buses while Sonkar is a cashier of the Uttarakhand Roadways posted at the bus stand.
The police officer said the bus used in the incident has been impounded and a forensic team is collecting evidence from inside.
Police said the incident came to light after the Dehradun Child Welfare Committee (CWC) was informed about a girl, aged 16-17, sitting alone on a bench at platform number 12 of the Interstate Bus Terminal (ISBT) here late at night on August 12.
The Dehradun CWC sent her to Bal Niketan, a government girls' home, for her safety.
During counselling at the Bal Niketan, she informed the authorities about the alleged rape, after which CWC member Pratibha Joshi filed a police complaint on Saturday evening.
On the basis of the complaint, a case was registered at the Patel Nagar police station under section 70 (2) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
The SSP inspected the area, formed a special police team to investigate the incident, and also met the victim and inquired about what happened.
Police said that during preliminary interrogation, the girl told them she was an orphan and that she was a resident of Punjab.
Later, she told them that she was a resident of Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. She first went to Delhi from Moradabad and then took a bus from Kashmiri Gate in Delhi and to Dehradun, where she was allegedly raped.
Police said the girl kept changing her statements initially, but on interrogation, she gave information about her family.
Police contacted the family and found out that the survivor's parents were alive. They were also told that the girl had fled her house in past also without informing anyone.
However, every time the family brought her home after getting information about her through various sources.
According to the SSP, Devendra told the police during interrogation that he saw the girl at Kashmiri Gate ISBT in Delhi, seeking information about how to reach Punjab.
The conductor suggested she board his bus to Dehradun and then take another to Punjab via Paonta Sahib, police said.
But after the bus reached Dehradun and all the passengers got off Devendra and driver Dharmendra allegedly raped her, police said, based on what Devendra told them.
He said that when two other drivers -- Ravi and Rajpal -- of the buses parked nearby came to know about this, they also went inside the bus and allegedly raped her.
Devendra said that he went to deposit money at the cash counter after the incident and told the cashier, Sonkar, about this, after which he also allegedly raped the girl on the bus, according to police.
The Congress has demanded strict action against the criminals.
Uttarakhand Pradesh Congress Committee president Karan Mahara strongly condemned the incident on 'X' and said, ""The incident of gang-rape of a teenager at a public place like the ISBT, where there is 24-hour movement of passengers and despite the police vigilance in view of the festivals, has exposed the government's attitude towards law and order and women's safety in Uttarakhand.""
 Referring to the recent alleged rape and murder of a female nurse working at a hospital in Rudrapur, the state Congress president said criminals in Uttarakhand do not have the slightest fear of law.
Reacting to the statement of the Congress, BJP state media in-charge Manveer Singh Chauhan said daughters are safe in the state and immediate cognisance of every incident is being taken.
Accusing the Congress of doing ""insensitive politics"", Chauhan said the Congress adopts double standards. He said the Congress has not yet been able to clarify its stand on the incident of rape and murder of a doctor in West Bengal.

The doctors have been demanding justice for the Kolkata rape and murder victim
New Delhi:
The resident doctors' association (RDA) of AIIMS on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention for enactment of a central law via an ordinance to protect healthcare workers and institutions across the nation.
The body has also urged for the restoration of law and order at the state-run RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata where a postgraduate trainee doctor was allegedly raped and killed.
The AIIMS RDA also drew the prime minister's attention to the subsequent vandalism at the hospital and the ""worrying rise in violence against doctors, healthcare workers, and medical institutions"" across the country.
Hospitals, like temples, are sanctuaries where healing and hope are nurtured, doctors of the Centre-run medical institution said in their letter.
""It is with a sincere and earnest plea that we request your support in ensuring the protection of these sacred spaces,"" the letter said.
The RDA said doctors work in environments filled with life-and-death challenges, which leaves them especially vulnerable.
Stating that escalating violence against doctors is ""profoundly troubling"", the association called for strong and uniform laws to safeguard those who have devoted their lives to the noble service of others.
Seeking the introduction of a central ordinance, the RDA said, ""We humbly beseech the Government of India, through your gracious intervention, to consider enacting a central law via ordinance to protect healthcare workers and institutions across the nation."" ""We sincerely believe that such a law, with stringent penalties, would act as a strong deterrent against violence and provide uniform protection for healthcare professionals throughout the country,"" the letter added.
The AIIMS RDA also implored immediate action to restore law and order at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital besides ensuring swift justice for the victim female doctor, saying it would not only offer solace but also set a strong precedent to deter such incidents in the future.
""We firmly believe that these measures will go a long way in ensuring the safety and security of healthcare professionals, thereby allowing us to continue our service to the nation with renewed confidence and peace of mind,"" the letter said.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognisance of the alleged rape-murder of the female doctor at the state-run hospital in the West Bengal capital, as protests demanding justice for the victim continued across the nation. It will hear the case on August 20.
The body of the postgraduate trainee with severe injury marks was found inside the seminar hall of the hospital's chest department on August 9. A civic volunteer was arrested by the Kolkata Police in connection with the case the next day.
On Saturday, the Indian Medical Association sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""benign"" intervention in the realising their demands that includes a central law to check violence against healthcare personnel and declaring hospitals safe zones with mandatory security entitlements.
The resident doctors of AIIMS have been on an indefinite strike suspending all elective and non-essential services including OPDs and wards to protest the R G Kar incident since August 12.

The protesting doctors have been demanding justice for the Kolkata rape and murder victim
New Delhi:
The Resident Doctors Association (RDA) at the AIIMS Delhi will today provide elective OPD services outside the Nirman Bhawan, which houses the Union health ministry amid protests over the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata on August 9.
Here Are Top Points On Doctors' Strike:
The resident doctors of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi said that their strike would continue. The AIIMS RDA also said it will provide free elective OPD services of around 36 specialties to patients outside Nirman Bhawan from 11 am.
They have been on an indefinite strike since August 12, suspending all elective and non-essential services including OPDs and wards to protest the rape-murder of a trainee doctor at the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. 
The protesting doctors have been demanding justice for the victim and a security act for medical personnel.
The AIIMS RDA also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention for the enactment of a central law via an ordinance to protect healthcare workers and institutions across the nation.
They also drew PM Modi's attention to the subsequent vandalism at the state-run Kolkata hospital and the ""worrying rise in violence against doctors, healthcare workers, and medical institutions"" across the country. The Faculty Association of AIIMS has requested people to wear black rakhis on Raksha Bandhan as a symbol of solidarity with healthcare professionals.
A group of Padma Awardee doctors has urgently appealed to President Droupaid Murmu for immediate intervention following the Kolkata incident. The doctors highlighted the rise in violence against healthcare professionals, particularly against women.
The Union health ministry had last week assured the protesting doctors of all possible efforts to ensure their safety. The Ministry on August 17 said it will form a committee to suggest measures for ensuring the safety of healthcare professionals.
The Supreme Court has taken up the rape-murder case and a three-judge bench led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud will hear the matter on Tuesday.
The case is already being heard by the Calcutta High Court, which has ordered that the probe be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation or CBI, overriding Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's August 18 ultimatum to the state police.
The body of the postgraduate trainee doctor was found in the seminar hall of the state-run hospital in Kolkata on August 9, triggering nationwide protests. A civic volunteer has been arrested in connection with the crime the next day.

New Delhi:
The Resident Doctors Association (RDA) at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) will be providing elective OPD services in front of Nirman Bhawan from 11 am on August 19 in continuation of their strike against the rape-murder incident of a postgraduate trainee doctor at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata.
In a press statement released on Sunday, RDA AIIMS stated, ""Resident doctors will be available for providing elective OPD services of around 36 specialities (including medicine, surgery, Obs&Gynae, paediatrics, ophthalmology, Orthopedics and others) to patients outside Nirman Bhawan. Emergency services will continue as before at our hospitals.""
This decision came after a discussion with the Action Committee for Central Protection Act and the general body of RDA AIIMS, where ""it was unanimously decided to continue the strike, as our demands remain unaddressed. This includes halting academic activities, elective OPDs, ward, and OT services, while maintaining emergency services, ICUs, emergency procedures and emergency OT.""
The release further stated that this was done to ""provide the patient care services in the nation's interest and as per our Hippocratic oath"" and ""to highlight the lack of security of healthcare professionals nationwide.""
They further urged ""the government to accept our plea for an urgent central ordinance for the safety and security of healthcare workers and institutes"" and requested the authorities ""to allow for the same and provide the necessary arrangements for the elective outpatient services outside Nirman Bhawan.""
Earlier, on August 9, a postgraduate trainee doctor was allegedly raped and murdered while on duty at RG Kar Medical College in Kolkata, sparking nationwide strikes and protests by the medical community.
On August 14, the protest site and the hospital campus at RG Kar were vandalised by a mob, prompting security personnel to disperse the crowd.

New Delhi:
""I don't want to be the next victim"", read placards carried by several women medics who were part of a march in Delhi on Saturday to protest against the alleged rape and murder of a trainee doctor at a state-run hospital in Kolkata last week. 
Hundreds of medics, including doctors and resident doctors, wearing stethoscopes over their white aprons, started their march from the Lady Hardinge Medical College on the sixth day of their agitation over the incident and to press for their demands such as a central law to check violence against healthcare personnel.
On reaching Connaught Place, they held an around 25-minute sit-in, before police removed barricades and allowed them to proceed to the Jantar Mantar for the next phase of their demonstration -- a candle light march.
Non-emergency services, such as OPD and diagnostics, and elective surgeries at city-based health facilities, including at Centre-run AIIMS, Safdarjung hospital and RML hospital, are hit since Monday. 
Inconvenience of patients further increased as personnel of private institutions such as Sir Ganga Ram, Fortis, and Apollo also joined protests on Sunday following a call by apex doctors' body Indian Medical Association (IMA) for a 24-hour nationwide withdrawal of non-emergency services. 
A patient from Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur, who had an appointment at the GTB Hospital here, said, ""I came to the Hospital on Tuesday but was told that doctors were on strike. It has been more than five days since doctors ceased work. I am going back as there is no point waiting."" 
Sarjeena, who contracted an infection a few months after her delivery, came to the hospital for a check-up but was told that ""only emergency patients are being treated"". 
At the Jantar Mantar, medics took out a candle light march and raised slogans such as ""We want justice,"" ""Hang the rapist"" and ""We want protection."" Earlier in the day, doctors at the Safdarjung and RML held a silent protest march, sporting black ribbons.
""As you are aware, in light of the heinous incident that occurred at the R G Kar Medical College, Kolkata, involving a resident doctor, the residents of our institute are on strike, demanding the urgent implementation of a 'Central Protection Act' to ensure a safe environment for practising doctors,"" the Faculty Association of AIIMS (FAIMS) said in a communication to the AIIMS-Delhi director.
The IMA on Saturday sought the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the implementation of its demands -- a thorough overhaul of the working and living conditions of resident doctors, a central law to check violence against healthcare personnel at workplaces, declaration of hospitals as safe zones with the first step being mandatory security entitlements, meticulous and professional investigation of the last week incident in Kolkata, and an appropriate and dignified compensation to the bereaved family.
The Union health ministry on Saturday released an official statement and said a committee will be formed to suggest all possible measures for ensuring the safety of healthcare professionals.
Representatives of all stakeholders, including the state governments, will be invited to share their suggestions with the committee, it added.
The ministry has requested the doctors agitating across the country to resume their duties in the larger public interest and in view of the rising number of dengue and malaria cases.
Responding to the ministry's statement, AIIMS Resident Doctors' Association (RDA) said the statement lacks confidence and trust.
It said similar committees have been formed in the past without any significant progress or the passage of relevant legislation.
""It was decided unanimously to continue the strike as our demands remain unaddressed. This includes halting academic activities, elective OPDs, ward, and OT services, while maintaining emergency services, ICUs, emergency procedures, and emergency OT,"" the RDA said in a statement.

Responding to reports that the fourth floor room where the crime took place has been vandalised, Kolkata Police said in a post on X, ""Crime scene is Seminar Room and it has not been touched. Don't spread unverified news. We will initiate legal action for spreading rumours.""

Late last night, when neighbourhoods across Bengal were witnessing massive gatherings by women to protest against the horrifying incident, a mob entered the medical college campus and went on the rampage. They attacked vehicles, damaged public property and police had use teargas shells to disperse the mob. Several police officers were injured in the clash.
While it is not yet clear who is behind the mob violence, Leader of the Opposition, BJP's Suvendu Adhikari, has alleged that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sent ""goons"" of the Trinamool College to disrupt the apolitical protest rally near the hospital.

""She thinks that she is the most shrewd person in the whole world and people won't be able to figure out the cunning plan that her goons appearing as protesters would mix with the crowd and carry out vandalism inside the RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.
""They were given safe passage by the Police, who either ran away or looked the other way so that these lumpens would enter the hospital premises and destroy areas containing crucial evidence so that it doesn't get picked up by the CBI,"" the BJP leader added.
Abhishek Banerjee, Trinamool Congress general secretary and Number 2 in the party, said the hooliganism and vandalism at RG Kar tonight ""exceeded all acceptable limits"". ""As a public representative, I just spoke with @CPKolkata, urging him to ensure that every individual responsible for today's violence is identified, held accountable, and made to face the law within the next 24 hours, regardless of their political affiliations. The demands of the protesting doctors are fair and justified. This is the minimum they should expect from the government. Their safety and security must be prioritised,"" Mr Banerjee said in a post on X.
The CBI is now investigating the rape and murder case that has shaken the nation. The central agency took over the investigation after the Calcutta High Court noted that Kolkata Police have made no significant progress in the case and transferred the case. The parents of the victim had filed a petition, seeking a probe monitored by the court to ensure evidence is not tampered with.

Court also declared Rs 17 lakh as compensation to the parents of the victim girl. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has sentenced a 25-year-old man to life imprisonment for raping and battering to death a 5-year-old girl in 2017, observing the ""brutality"" showed his criminal bent of mind.
Additional Sessions Judge Amit Sahrawat was hearing a case against the man who was a juvenile at the time of the offence and now tried as an adult offender. The bench found the man guilty of committing the offences of rape and murder.
""In the present case, the aggravating factors against the Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) are that firstly he has committed rape of a child, just of about 5 years, and thereafter mercilessly caused death of the said child by hitting stones on her head,"" the court said.
""The causation of such heinous offences itself explains the brutality caused by CCL and his criminal psychology which existed at the time of the offence,"" it added in its order dated August 3.
The court said the CCL was an adolescent (over 16 years) when he committed the crime here, and did not have the psychological maturity of an adult and so he could not be compared to an adult offender in the strictest manner.
""The option of treating the CCL as an adult offender only provides that if there is no reformation in the CCL, then he could be directed to undergo a longer or remaining sentence, as in case of major accused persons, but it does not mean that CCL has to be sentenced like an accused in each and every aspect,"" the court said.
It said the juvenile had to be sentenced only after considering his reformation and rehabilitation.
""While considering the fact that possibilities of a CCL, to become part of society, have to be kept open, this court is of considered opinion that the CCL should be given minimum sentence provided for the offences committed by him,"" the bench said.
Underlining that the minimum sentence for murder was life imprisonment, it said that as per the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, life imprisonment with the possibility of release could be awarded to him.
""While drawing a balance between the reformation of CCL and heinousness of offence committed by him, the CCL is directed to undergo the minimum sentence provided for offences committed by him, which is imprisonment for life with a fine of Rs 10,000 for the offence under IPC section 302 (murder),"" the court said.
The bench also sentenced him to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for the offence of rape.
The court observed that when a juvenile facing trial as an adult offender was found to have committed any offence, then at the time of passing the verdict on the quantum of sentence, it had to be considered whether the CLL was reformed.
It, however, said that the juvenile could not be released as he needed to be further reformed.
The bench noted that the convict was still involved in crimes such as unlawful sale, possession, and manufacture of intoxicants when he was a major and out of institutional care.
The man was also not remorseful about his misdeeds, which shows that there is no reformation in him and therefore if he is set free without any reformation, he could further get himself involved in other crimes, the court said.
It directed the prison authorities to provide him with education and employment.
""The District Child Protection Unit is directed to assess the reformation of CCL yearly and shall file its follow-up report before this court every year,"" the court said.
It also declared Rs 17 lakh as compensation to the parents of the victim girl.

During the hearing, the prosecutrix did not oppose the bail application. (Representational)
New Delhi:
Delhi's Tis Hazari Court recently granted bail to a student of the School of Open Learning (SOL) of Delhi University in a rape case, noting that the victim has not opposed the bail. The court also noted that the FIR was lodged after a delay of 176 days. The victim used to study with the accused at SOL and had a love affair with the accused.
Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Manoj Kumar granted bail to accused after noting that he is a young man of 20 years old and charge sheet has been filed.
While granting bail to the accused on June 22, the court said, ""Whether the accused physically assaulted the prosecutrix or not is a matter of trial.""
The court also noted that, as per MLC, there are no external injuries, and the prosecutrix had refused her internal medical examination. She also did not produce her mobile phone. Their friends were also interrogated and they did not support the allegations of the prosecutrix.
Advocate Deepak Sharma, counsel for accused, argued that accused has been in custody since April 12, 2024. There was a delay of 176 days in lodging the FIR. During investigation, friends of victim did not support allegations she levelled.
Delhi police have filed a charge sheet after an investigation, the counsel argued. Therefore, she should be granted bail.
During the hearing, the prosecutrix did not oppose the bail application.
On the other hand, the prosecution said that the accused committed sexual assault/rape upon the victim. The mobile phone of the accused was checked, and obscene photos/videos were found, which corroborated the statement of the victim. He may flee from justice and influence the witnesses; therefore, he should not be granted bail.
On March 28, 2024, an FIR was lodged at police station Sabzi Mandi on the basis of a complaint filed by the prosecutrix.
The bail application stated that the accused and victim have been classmates since 12th grade and study in SOL. They have had a love affair for the last two years.
As per the counselling report, the victim herself admitted that the accused is her boyfriend, as the plea stated.
As per the report, the alleged incident took place on October 4, 2023, at her house. Two friends were also present at her house, but their statements were not recorded. The family of the victim was not happy with their love affair.
Finally, an FIR was lodged on March 28, 2024, after a delay of 176 days. Though the victim had told her mother everything on March 25, the FIR was lodged on March 28.

New Delhi:
Delhi's Tis Hazari Court has sentenced a 49-year-old man to 10 years of imprisonment in a child marriage and rape case.
The court also ordered a compensation of Rs 10.5 lakh to a victim who was forced into a marriage due to her circumstances and raped when she was 13-year old.
The Special POCSO court in Delhi had on April 30 this year convicted the 49-year-old accused, a resident of Bihar, under Section 376 (2) (i) and (n) of Indian Penal Code (IPC), Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012 and Section 9/10 of Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.
Judge Ankit Mehta while pronouncing the quantum of sentence on June 7, 2024 in his verdict after examining all aspects of the case sentenced the accused to maximum sentences in child marriage and rape case respectively. Apart from the compensation of Rs 10.5 lakh, the court also imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 on the accused.
The court noted that the prosecution had established that the child was a victim of circumstances who was forced into marriage by her maternal grandmother who was the only one in her family to sustain a living. As per the victim's statement, she was the only child in the family with no parents and had left studies when she was staying at her maternal grandmother's residence where she was considered a 'liability'.
Her father had deserted the family while her mother was mentally challenged and not living with her. Since her grandmother was ailing, she had requested the Sarpanch and villagers to marry her off to the accused in case of her death. It was through a middle-woman who had informed the victim's grandmother that the accused had a wife who had passed away and was earning a handsome amount, noted the Court.
""After the death of my grandmother, it was against my will that the villagers forced me to marry the accused,"" she had revealed. The accused married her on February 23, 2017, in Bihar when she was over 13 years of age which was established due to a bone age test.
In her statement, the victim said that in the accused's village, she came to know about his previous two marriages. The first wife who had passed away had two teenage daughters who were living with the accused's mother while the second wife had left him.
""During the first two months after the accused got me to his village, he used to beat me mercilessly and force himself upon me which I resented,"" said the victim.
Sensing trouble in the village, the accused shifted her to Delhi where again he subjected the victim to torture for a sexual relationship. The merciless beating of the victim forced Delhi residents to inform police which initiated the process of registration of FIR and probe the incident.
It was the Delhi Legal Service Authority (DLSA) that appointed advocate Virender Verma to provide legal support to the victim during the trial period which was crucial for the prosecution that saw the delivery of justice.
Welcoming the pronouncement, advocate Verma affirmed that he had pleaded for maximum and rigorous imprisonment to the accused with adequate compensation for the victim. ""I express my gratitude to the honourable court which considered all aspects of the case expeditiously,"" he said.
Reacting to the Delhi court's verdict, lawyer, activist, and founder of Child Marriage Free India (CMFI), Bhuwan Ribhu, said, ""This is a landmark and welcome judgement, once again establishing that child marriage leads to child rape. I hope this acts as a precedent. By acting decisively against child marriage, we can end it by 2030. While the government aims to make India a developed country, it can only happen by ensuring access to free education until 18 years of age and eliminating child marriage.""
The victim recorded in her statement that she endured rape for more than a year with nowhere to go and no one to bank upon.
She told the court that her 66-year-old 'mother-in-law' also tortured her to go for physical relationship so that she bore a child from the accused. Based on the victim's complaint, his mother was also an accused in the case but the court acquitted her.

New Delhi:
A court in Delhi has sentenced a 33-year-old man to rigorous life imprisonment for repeatedly raping and impregnating his minor stepdaughter in 2019, saying in the ""morally repugnant"" incest case, the convict's illiteracy cannot be considered a mitigating factor.
It also observed that the convict deserved a ""severe sentence"" because of the nature of the crime and society's interest in protecting vulnerable children from horrendous experiences.
Additional Sessions Judge Babita Puniya was hearing the case against the stepfather who was convicted of the penal provision of rape and aggravated penetrative sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act last month.
Special Public Prosecutor Sharawan Kumar Bishnoi sought the ""strictest sentence"", saying that ""a clear and strong message should be sent to the society that such horrendous acts will not be countenanced"".
In an order passed on May 17, the judge rejected the argument of the defence counsel about the convict being illiterate and said, ""I am of the view that illiteracy cannot be considered as a mitigating factor, particularly in incest cases. It is not only legally punishable but is morally repugnant also."" She said the ""diabolical nature"" of the crime and the fact that the victim was the stepdaughter of the convict and was in his care and protection outweighed the personal circumstances of the convict, including his age.
""The interest of justice demands that the severest punishment must be imposed. The convict has failed dismally to show the existence of substantial and compelling reasons for taking a lenient view,"" the court said.
It underlined the various aggravating factors in the case, including the victim being an innocent and helpless child who became pregnant and had to undergo an abortion at around 16 years of age.
""The convict has preyed upon an innocent and vulnerable girl child to quench his covetousness and selfish needs. He repeatedly made the victim object of his lust and made her pregnant. I have no doubt in my mind that this must have been an excruciating pain that the victim or child endured,"" the judge said.
""The fact that the offence was committed by a stepfather, who was in a position of trust, against his innocent, defenceless old girl child is aggravating the offence,"" she added.
Sentencing the convict to rigorous imprisonment for life, the court clarified that it meant ""imprisonment for the remainder of his natural life"".
It observed, ""The nature of the crime and society's interest in protecting vulnerable children from horrendous experiences warrants a severe sentence.""

The high court said trial court gave ""unwarranted weightage to superficial contradictions""
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Tuesday held guilty a father of repeatedly raping his minor daughter for two years, reversing a trial court decision that acquitted him of all charges on the basis of delay in reporting the matter.
A bench headed by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait allowed appeals by the State as well as the victim along with her mother and brother against the acquittal, and remarked that instead of finding a ""monastery"" in her father's lap, the minor girl found a ""monster"".
Holding that every delay in reporting the matter cannot be branded fatal in a mechanical manner, the court noted that the victim, who was 10 years old at the time she was first raped, tolerated sexual assault by her father for approximately two years afterwards. She went to the police after noticing that her father had beaten her mother and brother instead of mending his ways, the court said.
It held that the testimony of the victim inspired full confidence and the trial court gave unwarranted weightage to superficial contradictions.
""The wrongdoer was not any outsider or stranger. The victim must have thought that she would find a 'monastery' in the lap of her father. Little did she realise that he was rather a 'monster',"" the bench, also comprising Justice Manoj Jain, said.
""In view of the apparent compelling reason that the finding recorded in order of acquittal is contrary to the evidence, we have no hesitation in reversing the same. 106. Consequently, we hereby allow both the appeals and hold the respondent guilty for commission of offences punishable under Section 6 (Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the POCSO Act and Sections 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) and 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) IPC,"" the court held.
The trial court had passed the order in June 2019 following the registration of a case in 2013.
The court directed that the matter be listed on May 24 for arguments on sentence.
In the order, the court observed that such incidents of sexual assault are often not reported because the victim and her family members feel that their image and repute would be tarnished and even in the present case, the victim claimed to have told her mother about the incidents but she was snubbed.
The court said it ""strongly"" felt and believed that the incident of the father beating up her mother and brother acted as a catalyst and acted as a ""saturation point"" for the victim and her family and therefore the delay could not be said to be fatal.
""We need not remind ourselves that we are dealing with a matter where a daughter has been raped by her own father inside her own house, not once but repeatedly... It is not difficult to understand the dilemma of such a mother as well,"" the court stated.
""In a patriarchal set up, which is still very much predominant in our country, such matters are either not reported at all or reported when it is beyond the tolerance of the victim. Here, the victim did not see any ray of hope as her father, despite being questioned, did not mend his ways and scolded not only his wife but also the victim and in such a peculiar situation, the victim kept on tolerating such sexual assault for approximately two years,"" added the court.
The court remarked that had the parties immediately rushed to the police, the victim might have been saved from perpetual trauma and sought a report on the payment of compensation to her.

In January this year, the top court granted anticipatory bail to Mr Khakha's daughter and son.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to grant default bail to the wife of suspended Delhi government official Premoday Khakha in a case of alleged sexual assault of a minor girl.
Mr Khakha, who served as Deputy Director in the Women and Child Development Department, is accused of raping a 16-year-old girl multiple times between 2020 and 2021, and his wife, Seema Rani, reportedly gave the minor survivor medicine to terminate her pregnancy.
A bench of Justices C.T. Ravi Kumar and S.V.N. Bhatti refused to interfere with the February 26 decision of the Delhi High Court rejecting the bail pleas filed by the Mr Khakha couple. Earlier, the trial court had denied the plea for statutory bail, rejecting the contention that the charge sheet filed was based on an incomplete investigation. Both Mr Khakha and his wife remain under judicial custody.
However, in January this year, the top court granted anticipatory bail to Mr Khakha's daughter and son, noting that the duo have joined the investigation.
A police source had said that Mr Khakha kept on raping the minor daughter of his friend for months, during which his wife also allegedly assisted him. ""As his wife also aided him in the act and did not report the matter to the police, we have added Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) in the FIR against his wife,"" the police source had said.
""The most shocking part is that when the victim got pregnant, she was threatened with dire consequences by the accused. When the accused narrated the matter to his wife, instead of helping the victim, the woman sent her son to buy abortion pills, which she gave to the victim,"" the source had said.
A case was registered under the relevant Sections of the Pocso Act and the Indian Penal Code against the accused.

The couple was arrested after the survivor recorded her statement.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to grant bail to the wife of suspended Delhi government officer Premoday Khakha, who allegedly raped a minor girl several times and impregnated her.
A bench of justices C T Ravikumar and S V N Bhatti dismissed the plea of the official's wife Seema Rani and said it was not inclined to interfere with the Delhi High Court order which had dismissed her plea.
Khakha has been accused of allegedly raping a minor girl several times between November 2020 and January 2021 and is currently in judicial custody after being arrested in August.
The minor was the daughter of a person known to the accused, according to police.
Rani is also an accused in the case. She allegedly gave the girl medicines to terminate her pregnancy. The woman is in judicial custody.
The couple was arrested after the survivor recorded her statement before a magistrate at a hospital.
The case was registered under the provisions of the POCSO Act and Indian Penal Code sections 376(2)(f) (being a relative, guardian or teacher of, or a person in a position of trust or authority towards the woman, commits rape on such woman) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to outrage the modesty of a woman).
IPC sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 313 (causing miscarriage without woman's consent) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) have also been invoked in the case, police said.

The man was facing prosecution in the rape case lodged against him in 2022 (Representational)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has set aside a trial court order which granted bail to a man in a rape case without hearing the alleged victim.
The high court said not giving an opportunity to the prosecutrix to be heard in proceedings after the occurrence of the offence would violate the Supreme Court's directions on a victim's rights.
Justice Navin Chawla set aside the June 2022 bail order and said the man shall be entitled to file a fresh bail plea before the trial court within two weeks, making it clear that he shall not be arrested until an order is passed by the lower court on his application.
""Be that as it may, as it cannot be denied that the prosecutrix had not been served with a copy of the bail application, nor was (she) issued notice of the same or given an opportunity to oppose the same, this would be in violation of the directions issued by the Supreme Court on the rights of the victim to be granted unbridled participatory rights in the proceedings and of being heard at every step post occurrence of the offence, including the right to be heard while deciding on the bail application.
""It has been held that contravention of the same shall result in grave miscarriage of justice,"" the high court said.
It passed the order on a plea by the woman challenging the trial court order.
The woman raised the issue that neither was she served with a copy of the bail application nor was she informed about the date of hearing before passing of the order.
The status report filed by the State before the high court also supported the woman's plea.
The high court, in its order, said, ""Considering the fact that the respondent no.2 (man) has been on bail since June 14, 2022 and the order is being set aside due to the trial court failing to comply with the procedure stipulated, it is directed that he shall file an application seeking bail, within a period of two weeks from today.
""Subject to such an application being filed, the man shall not be arrested until an order is passed by the trial court on such an application."" The high court said the question of the extension of the interim protection granted by it in this order, shall be at the discretion of the trial court.
The man was facing prosecution in the rape case lodged against him in 2022 at central Delhi's Rajinder Nagar police station.

The Court rejected the request for leniency in awarding the sentence (Representational)
New Delhi:
Delhi's Tis Hazari court has recently sentenced a man to life imprisonment for raping and impregnating his minor daughter aged 17. She gave birth to a child. This case pertains to Police Station Nihal Vihar area and an FIR was lodged in the year 2022.
Special judge (POCSO) Babita Punia sentenced the convict to life imprisonment under Section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The court said that life imprisonment shall mean the remainder of the natural life of the convict. The Court has also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the convict.
However, no separate sentence is awarded for offences under Section 354 A and Section 12 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as they were committed in the course of the same transaction.
The Court rejected the request for leniency in awarding the sentence and said, ""The ""diabolical"" nature of the crime and the fact that the victim was the convict's daughter and was in his care and protection clearly outweigh the personal circumstances of the convict, including his age.""
""The interest of justice demands that maximum sentence prescribed by the legislation must be imposed. The convict has failed dismally to show existence of substantial and compelling reasons for taking a lenient view,"" Special judge said in the order passed on March 22, 2024.
The court also noted that the convict used to write letters to his daughter during the course of the trial to emotionally influence her.
Praying to take a lenient view, it was submitted that the convict was the family's sole bread earner, he was under the influence of alcohol and could not differentiate between his wife and daughter.
The wife (mother of the victim) of the convict also prayed to the court for leniency. It was submitted by the Delhi Commission for Women's (DCW) counsel that the convict has shown no remorse for his horrendous rape of his daughter.
""He did not care that the victim was his own daughter or he was the protector as in Indian culture the one who protects is known as father. However, he turned predator when his wife was not at home,"" the DCW argued.
The Court has awarded compensation of a total of Rs 13 lakh to the victim for her relief and rehabilitation.
The Court has directed the jail authorities to pay 70 per cent of wages earned by the convict to his family for its needs and the remaining 30 per cent amount may be utilised by the convicts for his personal needs. However, he is at liberty to transfer more amount to his family, it said.
The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) counsel also said that the convict's wife works in a private school and earns just Rs 5-6,000 per month, and it was not sufficient for the family.

The court said the woman had ""falsely testified on oath"" (Representational)
New Delhi:
A court here has ordered launch of proceedings against a woman for falsely accusing four men of raping her.
Acquitting the accused, the court said women who misuse law to falsely implicate people in rape cases should be dealt with strictly.
Additional Sessions Judge Jagmohan Singh was hearing a case against the four accused--Satish, Yogesh, Satbir and Yogesh Gupta--who were alleged to have abducted and raped the woman in 2012.
Noting the evidence before it, the court said it was ""highly plausible"" that the prosecutrix married accused Satish on December 4, 2012 at an Arya Samaj temple in Delhi while concealing the fact that she was already married and had a child, and upon being confronted by him, she falsely implicated Satish and his three relatives.
The court said the woman had ""falsely testified on oath"" that she was abducted and taken to Karnal on November 29, 2012 where she was kept hostage till December 10 and gang-raped by the accused persons.
It noted the testimony of a priest that on December 4, 2012, the woman's marriage was solemnised with Satish at a temple.
The court also noted a mobile phone voice recording where she was conversing with accused Kuldeep about sorting her differences with Satish, while respectfully addressing him as 'Mamaji' (maternal uncle).
""The above conversation utterly belies the testimony of the prosecutrix regarding the alleged incident of abduction and gang rape at Karnal from November 29 to December 10, 2012. Thus, her testimony on this point is patently false,"" the court said.
""In the considered opinion of this court, such kind of women as the prosecutrix in the present case, who misuse the law to falsely implicate persons of the heinous offence of rape should be dealt with strictly. Therefore, this court is of the considered opinion that it is in the interest of justice that cognisance of the offence of giving false evidence is taken against the prosecutrix,"" it added.
In a verdict pronounced last month, the court directed initiation of proceedings against her under Section 344 CrPC (summary procedure of trial for giving false evidence).
It said the prosecution has failed to prove any of the charges against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. ""Accordingly, accused Satish, Kuldeep and Yogesh Gupta are hereby acquitted of the charged offences,"" the court said. Since had Satbir died during the trial, and charges against him were abated.

Concerned Over Religious Conversions For Evading Law In Rape Cases: Court

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has expressed concern about religious conversion done solely for the purpose of marriage or evading law, such as by men facing rape allegations, and issued a slew of guidelines to be followed in such matters.
The high court said there should be an informed consent of the person who is willing to embrace another religion and should be fully cognisant of the multifaceted implications embedded in such a significant life choice.
It said that by providing a detailed understanding of the religion and its associated ramifications, the individual must be made aware of the potential shifts in his or her legal standing post-conversion.
""Conversion to another religion which is uninformed may not prepare a convert with the consequences that they will now not be able to follow their form of religion in case the religion they are converting to, does not permit so.
""This becomes more critical in case their reverting back to their religion may ensue legal, matrimonial, succession and custody related consequences. This court is only concerned with such situations. These situations may arise by conversion to any religion whatsoever,"" Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma said.
The high court's judgment came while refusing to quash an FIR lodged against a man for the offence of rape and criminal intimidation on the ground that he and the alleged victim have compromised and married each other.
It said the facts and investigation revealed the ""story of love, lies, law, and litigation"" as it transpired that the man and the woman, who were already married to different partners, had married each other.
While the man, a Muslim, as per his personal law could marry for a second time, he could not have married this woman, who was a Hindu, as her husband was alive and she was not divorced.
The court said that it must not be expected that as a matter of right, the marriage between the prosecutrix and the accused is sufficient ground for quashing the FIR of every case registered under Section 376 (rape) of IPC.
It noted that the timing of the marriage is also crucial as it was made the basis of plea for quashing. The marriage took place on the same date of the woman's conversion in 2022, ten days after registration of FIR.
The court said its concern was critical as one after another, courts are confronted with cases where conversion to one religion or the other was being done only for the purpose of marriage and evading law which has deeply troubled its judicial conscience.
More so, since in many cases, quashing of FIR lodged under Section 376 of IPC is sought on the ground of conversions and marriage between the accused and the victim, which is followed by divorce or desertion of the victim after quashing of the FIR, it said.
""Without a doubt sexual violence against a woman should invite no tolerance. At the same time, manipulating the system by the parties to a case under Section 376 of IPC would equally need to be dealt with a stern hand and serious efforts should be made to address and remedy failings within the criminal justice system and through our society,"" the court said.
It also said that the individual who is facilitating the conversion has the utmost responsibility to meticulously verify the identity of the prospective spouse. It said that the verification process is important to ensure transparency and authenticity throughout the conversion and subsequent marriage proceedings.
It directed that the affidavits ascertaining the age, marital history, marital status and its evidence of both the parties must be obtained at the time of inter-faith marriage after conversion by the concerned authorities, except in cases of marriages performed under Special Marriage Act.
The court directed that an affidavit must also be obtained to the effect that the conversion is being done voluntarily after understanding the implications and consequences related to marital divorce, succession, custody, and religious rights.
It added that the certificate of conversion and marriage should be in additional vernacular language understood by the prospective convert in proof of the fact that he or she has understood the same.
The high court was also critical of the way the magistrate recorded the statement of the woman by doing a mere formality in a typed initial performa.
It asked the Director (Academics) of Delhi Judicial Academy to conduct a workshop for magistrates on the importance and procedure to be followed while recording statements of sexual assault victims under Section 164 of CrPC.
""The judiciary, being a crucial pillar of democratic Bharat, is always striving to deliver the best and the need for continuous judicial education is a step forward in this direction for a more dynamic and professional judiciary,"" it said.

New Delhi:
A 12-year-old girl was allegedly gangraped by a man and three boys after a woman lured her to a secluded spot in Delhi's Sadar Bazaar, police said on Sunday. All five accused, including the three minors, have been detained, they added.
Police said the woman was a customer at the man's tea stall in Old Delhi's Sadar Bazaar. The three boys aged 12, 14 and 15 years were workers at the stall.
On January 1, the tea stall owner asked the woman, who worked as a waste picker in the area, to arrange for a girl to ""celebrate the New Year."" The accused had built a temporary shelter out of plastic tarpaulin inside a sealed building in the area to spend the night. Police suspect that the man might have offered the woman some money in exchange for bringing the girl to them.
The next day, the woman met the 12-year-old girl, another ragpicker, and allegedly told her to collect garbage from the roof of a building in Khurshid Market. When the girl reached the area, the four accused were waiting for her. They took turns to rape her inside the temporary structure. Afterwards, they threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident.
The girl returned to her home in North West Delhi and kept quiet for two days. On January 5,  when she returned to Sadar Bazaar to pick garbage, she confided in her cousin who lives in the area. The cousin informed her parents and the family approached the police.
A case of gangrape was registered and all the accused were detained, hours after the survivor lodged her complaint, police said.
The tea shop owner is a resident of Chhattisgarh while the three boys who worked at his shop hail from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.

""Get It Down"": Court To Rahul Gandhi On Post Revealing Rape Victim's Identity

The court was hearing a 2021 petition by social activist
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Thursday asked Congress leader Rahul Gandhi to take down his social media post which revealed the identity of a minor Dalit girl, raped and murdered in 2021, so that the child's identity is protected worldwide.
In the post, which stands geo-blocked by social media platform X in the country, Mr Gandhi published a photograph with the parents of the nine-year-old Dalit girl who died under suspicious circumstances on August 1, 2021, with her parents alleging that she was raped, murdered and cremated by a crematorium's priest in southwest Delhi's Old Nangal village.
Following the post, Mr Gandhi's account was suspended by the social media platform for some time but it was subsequently restored.
A bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Manmohan Thursday observed although the post was stated to have been taken down by X, it continued to be available outside India and asked the counsel for Mr Gandhi to have it removed.
""If we have to protect the identity of the victim, it is necessary it is done all over the world,"" the court said.
""Why don't you take it down? Please take down your post because worldwide it must come down. Please seek instructions...otherwise it will be picked up by press all over the world. It can't be done like this. Please get it down,"" the bench, also comprising Justice Mini Pushkarna, told Mr Gandhi's counsel advocate Tarannum Cheema.
The court was hearing a 2021 petition by social activist Makarand Suresh Mhadlekar seeking registration of an FIR against Mr Gandhi for revealing the identity of the victim by publishing a photograph with her parents on X, formerly called Twitter.
In response to the petition, the Delhi Police said the petition has become infructuous after an investigation was ordered and the post made unavailable in India, and sought permission to file a status report in a sealed cover as it did not want to ""scandalise"" the matter.
Delhi government lawyer Santosh Kumar Tripathi said unless the main crime of rape was proven, the subsequent act of publishing the identity of an alleged victim does not become a crime and investigation on the issue of revelation of the victim's identity by Mr Gandhi was underway.
""The petition does not survive. It has become infructuous. Investigation has been ordered,"" he said.
The court granted four weeks' time to police to file a status report in a sealed cover.
Counsel for the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) contended that the identity of a victim of sexual assault has to be protected from the moment the crime comes to light and the protection does not come into force after the trial has concluded.
The NCPCR earlier said there are no exceptions to the law protecting the identity of minor victims of sexual offences, and ""police must register an FIR and take consequential action"".
The counsel for the family of the child victim raised objections with respect to the discussion on the criminal case in an open court.
Senior advocate Mahesh Jethmalani, appearing for the petitioner, also opposed the police's stand, saying the agency failed to understand the seriousness of the matter and the identity of the child has to be protected even at the stage of allegations.
It was also emphasised that the content continued to be available and was withheld only in India.
X's counsel said the removal of the post worldwide involved issues concerning extraterritorial application of Indian laws.
On October 5, 2021, a bench headed by then Chief Justice DN Patel had issued notice to Twitter on the petition which alleged that Mr Gandhi was ""attempting to take political mileage out of the unfortunate incident"".
The court had then refused to issue notice to other respondents, i.e. Mr Gandhi, the Delhi Police and NCPCR on the public interest litigation (PIL) at that stage.
The petitioner has alleged that Mr Gandhi violated the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, which prohibit the disclosure of identity of minor victims of sexual offences.
The plea also sought initiation of appropriate legal action against Mr Gandhi by NCPCR.
The matter would be heard next in January.

DCW has taken suo moto cognisance in the alleged rape and murder case of a nine-year-old girl. (File)
New Delhi:
Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has taken suo moto cognisance in the case of kidnapping and alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old girl who had been missing since December 12 from Swaroop Nagar.
In a letter dated December 19, Delhi Commission for Women Chairperson Swati Maliwal said, ""The Delhi Commission for Women has taken suo-moto cognizance of media reports stating that a 9-year-old girl was missing since December 12 from Swaroop Nagar. It has been reported that the family's landlord allegedly abducted, raped and killed the minor girl. It has been stated that the accused later dumped her body in the Munak canal. This is a very serious matter.""
DCW Chairperson further demanded a copy of FIR registered in the matter.
""Details of the accused arrested in the matter. If no accused has been arrested, please provide reasons for the same. Whether the body of the girl has been recovered. If no, please provide reasons for the same. Detailed Action Taken Report in the matter,"" the chairperson demanded in the letter.
She further added considering the gravity of the matter, please provide the sought information to the Commission by December 22, 2023.
The police on Tuesday said that a 52-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping, raping and killing the minor.
The accused, identified as Sanjeev Rana, later dumped her body in the Munak canal. A team of divers has been brought in to trace the girl's body, police said.
According to officials, the police received information about the kidnapping of the girl on December 12, based on which a case was registered. While the search for the missing girl was ongoing, the accused met with an accident and was admitted to a hospital in Rohini area on December 15. His statement, however, could not be recorded as doctors at the hospital declared him unfit.
The police, during the investigation, found out that the girl sat in the accused's vehicle on a nearby street on the day she went missing.
On December 17, the statement of the accused was recorded by the police after he was declared fit.
During this, he confessed to kidnapping the girl and killing her. In his initial confession, he revealed that he dumped the girl's body in Munak canal, DCP Outer North Ravi Kumar Singh said.
Since December 17, five divers have been deployed to search for the girl's body in the canal and a separate team has been formed to check the accused's travel route on the day of the kidnapping. A team of divers from Khajuri is being brought in and the search for the girl's body is on, DCP said.
The accused has been arrested for the kidnapping, rape, and murder of the minor girl, he added.
Police have registered a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the POCSO Act against him.

Court said there were ""countless inconsistencies"" in the woman's complaint (Representational)
New Delhi:
A sessions court here has discharged a man in a rape case registered against him in 2020, citing ""countless inconsistencies"" in the complaint of the alleged victim and saying mere general allegations are not sufficient to raise grave suspicion against the accused.
The court, however, ordered framing of charges against another accused for the alleged offences pertaining to Indian Penal Code Section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt).
Additional Sessions Judge Navjeet Budhiraja was hearing a case against Mohit, who was accused of raping and having unnatural sex with the complainant, while Damodar was alleged to have hit the woman's husband and insulted her modesty.
The judge noted the alleged victim's complaint and statement, except for one occasion, did not mention the exact date and time when rape was allegedly committed, in spite of her claim that the torture continued for two years.
""The offence of rape and carnal intercourse is of serious nature and mere general allegations are not sufficient to raise grave suspicion against the accused which would warrant the framing of charges against him,"" the judge said.
The court said according to the complaint, the alleged incidents of sexual assault had been continuing for two years before the filing of the complaint but ""no plausible and tenable explanation"" was provided for the delay in lodging the complaint.
""The complainant alleged that Mohit had offered her a cold drink and after consuming the same, she became intoxicated, and he then committed rape upon her and also made a video of the incident and on that pretext, he kept on continuously raping her,"" the court said in an order dated December 15.
""However, in the mobile phone seized at the instance of the accused, no such video was found or discovered as per the report of forensic science laboratory (FSL),"" it added.
The court said according to the final report submitted by the Delhi Police, there were ""countless inconsistencies"" in the woman's complaint. It said there was a history of minor quarrels between the accused and the alleged victim's family.
""I do not find the allegation of rape and carnal intercourse against the accused Mohit to be substantiated for framing of charge against him,"" it said.
Regarding the role of Damodar, the court noted the specific allegation that he had hit the complainant's husband, besides insulting the woman's modesty during an altercation on May 31, 2020.
Noting the evidence before it, the court said Damodar had to be tried for the offences under IPC sections 323 and 509.

""In the present case, the victim is the only eye witness but her testimony is full of improvements.""
New Delhi:
A court here has acquitted two accused persons of committing aggravated penetrative sexual assault on a 13-year-old minor in 2019, saying the alleged victim's testimony was ""highly unreliable"" because of several improvements or contradictions.
The court, which discharged the third accused from the charges of sexually harassing and wrongfully confining the complainant, also slammed the investigating officer (IO) for ""serious lapses"" in the investigation.
The court's statement came during a recent hearing in a case against the trio under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
Additional Sessions Judge Amit Sahrawat who was hearing the case said in cases of rape or penetrative sexual assault, the testimony of the victim is sufficient to prove the case but it should be of ""sterling quality"" and there ""should be a ring of truth around it"".
Noting the evidence before the court, the judge said there were material contradictions in the alleged victim's statement regarding the name of the accused persons and also the number of times the offence was committed.
Her testimony regarding when she came in contact with the accused was also ""highly contradictory"", he said.
""In the present case, the victim is the only eye witness but her testimony is full of improvements or contradictions and therefore highly unreliable, and except this, there is no other witness or evidence on record to prove the prosecution's case,"" the court said.
Referring to a 2020 verdict of the Supreme Court, the bench said the victim's testimony ""cannot be taken as gospel truth when it is full of improvements or contradictions"".
""Hence it can be said that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly, the benefit of the doubt is given to all three accused persons,"" it said.
Slamming the IO for ""serious lapses"" in the investigation, the court said that the Delhi Police officer did not collect the details of the hotel where the assault on the victim was allegedly committed, nor did she collect the call details record (CDR).
""It is very unfortunate to say that the IO has become a helpless person, that the hotel owner did not answer her notice and she filed a half-baked charge sheet,"" the court said, adding that regarding the collection of the CDR, the officer ""sent an email and thereafter kept sleeping"".
The court also deprecated the IO's conduct for visiting the spot a month after the alleged incident.
Noting the medico-legal case (MLC), according to which there were no abrasions or injuries on the victim's private parts, the court dismissed the prosecution's argument that her hymen was torn.
""When there are so many contradictions or improvements in the testimony of the victim and there is no other independent fact on record to corroborate her testimony, then torn hymen cannot be taken as the only cause of rape or penetrative sexual assault,"" it said.
The bench added, ""There is no other evidence or witness on record which could corroborate the testimony of the victim, rather other evidence on record has put even more dents on the prosecution's case.""

The judge underscored that the prosecutrix had failed to identify all the accused in the court
New Delhi:
Almost eight years after they were accused of sexually assaulting a woman, a court in Delhi has acquitted four men, saying the prosecution's case was doubtful and the benefit of the doubt should be given to them.
Additional Sessions Judge Rajinder Singh was hearing a case against the four accused, one of whom was charged under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the others under section 376D (gang rape).
According to the prosecution, the woman, who was working as a domestic help, left her employer's house to meet someone on January 25, 2016, following which one of the accused took her to his room in west Delhi, where she was allegedly raped twice by the accused and his accomplices.
The court noted the prosecutrix's statement, which said the woman was with the culprits until 7 am on January 26, 2016. A prosecution witness, who took her to an NGO on hearing her plea for help, met the complainant on January 31, following which a case was lodged, it noted.
""It is not clear where the prosecutrix was from the evening of January 26 till January 31,"" the court said in its order dated December 11.
""Due to the non-explanation of the whereabouts of the prosecutrix for the aforenoted period as well as the delay in reporting the matter, the prosecution's case becomes doubtful,"" it added.
The judge underscored that the prosecutrix had failed to identify all the accused in the court and there was no forensic or medical evidence to connect them with the alleged incident of rape.
""The prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and the benefit of the doubt shall go to the accused persons,"" it said.

New Delhi:
In a significant order, a Delhi court allowed a man to walk free in a rape case after finding there was no ""grave suspicion"" warranting framing of charges against him.
Additional Sessions Judge Anjani Mahajan was hearing a case against the man, against whom the woman had recorded statements before the police and the judicial magistrate as well.
Taking note of the submissions of lawyer Sumeet Verma that the rape case was foisted on the accused following a theft FIR against the woman, the sessions court said, ""The prosecution's own material improbabilises her (prosecutix's) statement and does not raise a strong suspicion against the accused of having committed the alleged offences."" 
Referring to a 2010 judgment of the Supreme Court, the judge said, ""No grave suspicion arises against the accused warranting framing of charge against him therefore, the accused stands discharged for the offences alleged."" In an order passed on December 6, the court said the averments made by the woman in her recorded statement were ""vastly different"" from the allegations in her complaint.
According to the complaint, the accused raped her when she had gone to the accused's house to work as a maid on March 15, 2018, the court noted. The next day the prosecutrix again went to the accused's house and following his misbehaviour, filed a complaint mentioning his name, it noted.
The recorded statement, however, said that the prosecutrix did not know the accused employer's name and that he raped her after she refused to withdraw some money from an ATM on his behalf, the court noted.
There were also contradictions in both versions regarding the date and manner of making the police complaint, it noted.
The court noted the submissions of lawyer Verma that the rape FIR were ""merely a counterblast"" to the theft case registered by the man against the complainant on March 16, 2018.
It further noted the advocate's submissions underlining that the Delhi High Court while granting anticipatory bail to the accused in June 2018, had observed that the complaint needed to be examined thoroughly on several aspects.
These included whether the complainant had filed a false and frivolous complaint along with the facts about the recovery of money from her house and that she refused to undergo a medical examination, the court noted.
Agreeing with the averments, the court said that Delhi Police did not conduct a thorough examination of the complaint before filing its charge sheet.
Regarding the FIR filed by the accused, the court noted that when the IO went to his house on March 16, 2018, the police official found that the accused and the prosecutrix were quarrelling over some monetary issue.
At that time, the complainant did not allege rape, it said adding, later Rs 12,900 was recovered from the prosecutrix's house, for which she could not provide any satisfactory answer.
The court said the first call made to the police was by the accused and even in the PCR call made by the prosecutrix, the information provided was not of rape but of 'ched chaad'.

According to officials, Tronica city police and the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team arrested two of the accused following an encounter.
On information about the movement of a suspect, Zunaid (20), in the Khanpur area on Sunday afternoon, police tried to stop him but he opened fire on the team. He sustained two bullet injuries in his legs in retaliatory firing, DCP (rural) Vivek Chandra Yadav said.
Other accused Imran (23) was also arrested after being injured in a cross-firing on Sunday night. During interrogation, the duo confessed to having raped the woman on November 30 along with one other, he said.

The court also noted there was another FIR where the complainant was an accused. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A court here while granting bail to a doctor accused of rape observed that the evidence suggest that the man and the alleged survivor had a sexual relationship on a ""consensual basis.""
Slamming the Investigating Officer (IO) for not conducting a ""fair investigation,"" the court directed an enquiry regarding the manner of the investigation by a higher officer.
Additional Sessions Judge Dhirendra Rana was hearing the bail plea of the doctor, who was accused of raping and sodomising the complainant on the pretext of marriage on May 31 this year.
Noting that the complainant refused her internal examination, the judge said there was no medico-legal case to support the allegations of rape and sodomy.
He also underlined that the court had directed the investigating officer to verify the complainant's antecedents and according to the IO's report, she had earlier registered an FIR against another man with similar allegations, the judge said.
The woman had also lodged a complaint of criminal intimidation, criminal conspiracy, wrongful restraint and other penal provisions against another person, where the IO concerned had filed a closure report, the court noted.
It also noted that there was another FIR where the complainant was an accused.
Also, a key witness in the case, who was reportedly her friend, had registered an FIR for the offence of rape against another person, the court said.
""Therefore, the antecedents of the complainant and her friend are reflecting something else which is in contradiction to her allegations in the present case.""
The court had in a recent order noted that the alleged survivor also filed a complaint against the doctor before the Delhi Government Mediation and Conciliation Centre in July 2023.
It said that she did not mention rape in that complaint and the matter was dismissed because of her non-appearance.
""It is surprising to observe that despite the alleged rape, the complainant applied for mediation instead of informing the police and getting herself medically examined to support her allegations,"" the court said.
It said the complainant did not provide her phone for investigation, nor did she join the investigation. Also, she had not disclosed her present address to the IO, the court said.
The court said the investigation of the accused was complete and the remaining probe had to be conducted based on the facts available on record.
""Accused is not involved in any other case and is a doctor by profession. The chat history placed on record reflects that both parties were in a relationship and without mentioning the contents of the messages, it is clear that the sexual relationship was being continued on a consensual basis,"" it said.
""Considering the facts and circumstances of this case, I deem it appropriate to admit the accused to regular bail subject to furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs 25,000 with one surety in the like amount,"" the court added.
During the proceedings, the accused's counsel, Advocate Harish Kumar Gupta said his client was ""lured and trapped into a racket of honey trapping being run by the complainant along with her associates.""
Underscoring that it was the ""need of the hour to look into the conduct of the IO,"" the court said the doctor filed a complaint against the alleged survivor alleging ""honey trap"" on October 17 this year, but the IO did not take any action.
""It was the duty of the IO to verify the contents of this complaint without any delay…IO ought to have initiated action on the complaint of the accused…Instead of doing so, FIR was registered against the accused on October 25 and the accused was arrested on October 27,"" the court said.
It said no police remand was asked by the IO for recovery of any article or evidence or preparation of any 'pointing out memo' of the alleged place of occurrence.
""I have also gone through the case diary where the statement of the complainant was recorded on October 25 after preparation of her MLC but a blank space has been left in the statement to fill in the MLC number which reflects that either the statement was recorded prior to the preparation of MLC or IO is not vigilant about the proceedings to be conducted by her in a serious offence like rape,"" the judge said.
""It was the duty of the IO to conduct a fair investigation which seems to be apparently missing in this case,"" he added.
The judge then directed that an inquiry had to be conducted by the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) concerned regarding the ""manner in which investigation has been done"" by the IO.

The court dismissed a petition filed by the accused.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has refused to close criminal proceedings against a man accused of raping a minor, saying the subsequent marriage between the two was no reason for quashing the FIR and the charges against him were ""serious in nature"".
Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain referred to a Supreme Court ruling which said the offence of rape cannot be compounded and quashed on the basis of a settlement between the parties.
""The respondent no.2 (survivor) in the FIR has alleged that the petitioner had sexual intercourse with her multiple times when she was just 16 years old. The respondent no. 2 also got pregnant due to this reason,"" the court noted.
""The allegations as levelled by the respondent no. 2 are serious in nature. The mere fact that the respondent no. 2 got married with the petitioner subsequently does not entail quashing of FIR. The present FIR pertains to offences punishable under section 376 IPC and section 6 of the POCSO Act which are serious in nature,"" it said in a recent order.
The survivor told the high court that she had settled her disputes with the petitioner and married him of her own free will.
The State opposed the petition by the accused seeking quashing of the FIR and said the offences are non-compoundable and serious. Compoundable offences are those where rival sides can reach a compromise.
In view of the top court's decision that such crimes are against society and cannot be quashed on reaching a compromise, the court dismissed the accused's petition.
""After considering all facts and gravity of allegations, the present petition cannot be allowed and FIR bearing no.0360/2020 registered under section 376 IPC and section 6 POCSO Act at P.S. Baba Haridas Nagar along with consequential proceedings including judicial proceedings ...cannot be quashed,"" the court concluded. '
""The present petition along with pending application, stands dismissed,"" the court ordered.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Wednesday summoned BJP leader Syed Shahnawaz Hussain on a woman's complaint alleging rape and criminal intimidation. The court took cognisance of the alleged offence and directed the former Union minister to appear before it on October 20.

Magistrate in her statement u/s 164 Cr.PC,"" the judge said.
The police had filed a report before the court seeking cancellation of the FIR.

The Delhi High Court upheld the acquittal of a man accused of raping minor girl. (Representational)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Monday upheld the acquittal of a man accused of forcibly keeping a minor girl in his house and repeatedly raping her, saying while the testimony of a victim alone is sufficient to establish guilt, overall circumstances have to be considered to arrive at a ""just decision"".
A bench headed by Justice Suresh Kumar Kait dismissed an appeal by the State against the trial court order and said the prosecution not only failed to bring on record the exact age of the prosecutrix but also could not prove that the accused had forcibly made physical relations with her.
Noting that the victim had visited the native village of the accused claiming to be his wife and did not raise alarm on earlier occasions, the court remarked that ""the behaviour of prosecutrix speaks a volume about her conduct"" and a case of ""false accusation"" cannot be ruled out.
""The victim has deposed that the accused had made relations thrice with her in the DC Park and also stated that there were public persons in the park but she neither raised any alarm nor any public person noticed it, which is highly unbelievable,"" observed the bench, also comprising Justice Neena Bansal Krishna.
During her cross-examination, the bench said, the prosecutrix also admitted that the house had two doors, and windows and ventilators at her height level yet she did not raise her voice or make any effort to escape.
It seems she willingly continued living in the house of the accused for 27 days, it added.
The accused faced criminal proceedings on the basis of an FIR registered for alleged commission of offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including rape, and the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).
The court also upheld the acquittal of the father of the accused in the matter on the basis of ""benefit of doubt"".
The court, in its order, stated that the prosecution did not place on record any document to establish the correct age of the prosecutrix who first claimed that she was 17 years old and then said during her examination before the trial court that she was 19 while her complainant brother claimed she was 12 years old.
""There is no doubt to the legal position that testimony of the prosecutrix alone is sufficient to bring home the guilt of an accused for committing offence under Section 376 (rape) of the IPC, however, before arriving at a just decision, the Court also has to consider the overall facts and circumstances of the case,"" it said.
""This court is of the opinion that the learned trial court has rightly held that the prosecution has failed to prove guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubts. Finding no error in the impugned judgment dated 07.08.2019, the present petition seeking leave to appeal is dismissed,"" it said.

Courts can't be used to pressure a party to act in a particular manner, the Delhi High Court said
New Delhi:
Courts cannot be used as ""marriage facilitators"" between parties in sexual offence cases, the Delhi High Court said today.
The judicial system, the High Court said, cannot be used to settle scores or pressure a party to act in a particular manner.
The court made the observations while dismissing an anticipatory bail petition by an accused in a case of alleged rape of a woman on the false pretext of marriage.
The accused sought pre-arrest bail on the ground that he was ready to marry the victim. The petition said the woman's father, who was earlier not ready for the inter-caste marriage, was now prepared to accept the marriage.
Justice Swarana Kanta Sharma, however, observed that the facts and documents on record showed that both the accused as well as the complainant took ""the judicial system and the investigating agencies for a ride and are trying to manipulate the judicial system to their advantage in different ways"".
""In this court's opinion, the courts of law cannot be used as a forum for the purpose of facilitating marriages and be used as marriage facilitators by first lodging an FIR alleging that the accused, after establishing physical relations, had refused to get married to the victim and later appear before the court for grant of bail which they have been opposing for many months,"" the court said.
The state opposed the plea on the grounds that the allegations were serious in nature and the accused never joined the investigation and is missing.
The court said the judicial system and the investigating agency have invested time and resources into the case, and it has become a trend to burden the judicial system with such complaints that clog the dockets of the courts.
""In many cases, when bail is granted at the request of the complainant, after some time, applications/petitions for cancellation of bail are filed before this Court on the ground that after obtaining bail, the accused did not fulfil his promise of getting married or that after getting married to the rape victim, the victim was abandoned by the accused,"" the court said.
""The courts cannot be used as matrimonial facilitators for the purpose of pressurizing the accused to get married to the victim or be denied bail, or by the accused for obtaining bail by asking the complainant to appear before the Court and state that he was ready to get married to her,"" stated the court.
In the present case, the court noted, there was nothing in the trial court proceedings or the earlier proceedings here to suggest that the parties were contemplating getting married or that the accused had even admitted to having a consensual relationship with the alleged victim.
It said it is only at this stage that the accused ""presented an entirely contradictory stance of marriage"".
""This is nothing short of taking the judicial system and the investigating agency for a ride by both the parties through their conduct and different stands taken before the courts and the investigating agency,"" the court observed.
""The judicial system cannot be used either to settle scores with each other or pressurize any party to act in a particular manner to reach one's goal. Considering the overall facts and circumstances of the case, this Court does not find it a fit case for grant of anticipatory bail as the case has travelled from the point of lodging of the FIR till the present point of the investigation,"" it said.
The court said truth has to prevail for which custodial interrogation of the accused may be required.

Premoday Khakha allegedly raped a minor several times between November 2020 and January 2021.
New Delhi:
The Delhi Police is likely to record the statements of people concerned in connection with the alleged rape of a minor girl by a senior city government officer, officials said on Wednesday.
Investigation in the case is underway and the statement of around eight to 10 people connected with the incident will be recorded, a senior officer said.
Premoday Khakha, who has since been suspended by the Delhi government, allegedly raped a minor several times between November 2020 and January 2021 and impregnated her.
His wife Seema Rani is accused of giving the girl medicines to terminate her pregnancy. The couple has two children.
The minor girl was staying at the residence of the accused, a family friend, after her father passed away in October 2020.
When the survivor informed Rani about the incident, she allegedly blamed her. She also accused Rani of being strict and beating her if she scored poorly in school exams, the survivor said in her police complaint.
The girl never told her mother about her ordeal, thinking that she would disbelieve her. The girl returned home with her mother in 2021.
Later, whenever the accused met her in church, he allegedly touched the minor girl inappropriately. The girl stopped attending church after July, the police said.
A team will also visit the church in connection with the investigation, they said.
A court here on Wednesday extended by 14 days Khakha's judicial custody. Rani has also been sent to jail for another 14 days.
They were arrested on Monday after the victim recorded her statement before a magistrate at a city hospital. PTI NIT SZM

Premoday Khakha had allegedly raped the girl several times. (File)
New Delhi:
A court here on Wednesday extended by 14 days the judicial custody of suspended Delhi government officer Premoday Khakha, who allegedly raped a minor girl several times and impregnated her.
The judicial custody of his wife Seema Rani, who is accused of giving the girl abortion pills to terminate her pregnancy, was also extended by 14 days.
Both were produced before Additional Sessions Judge (POCSO) Richa Parihar.
Umashankar Gautam, the counsel for the accused, said the court has sought a report on the medical board's findings about the vasectomy procedure Khakha has claimed to have undergone, before his judicial custody ends on September 6.
The advocate claimed as Khakha had undergone vasectomy in November 2005, he couldn't have impregnated the girl.
""The medical board has been formed to find whether any lacuna occurred during the vasectomy surgery. Its report will be submitted before the court,"" he said.
He said the court has directed Delhi Police to ""accelerate"" the investigation and file the charge sheet timely.
""Police did not file any application seeking police custody of the accused persons,"" he said.
Khakha had allegedly raped the girl several times between November 2020 and January 2021. She was staying at the residence of the accused, a family friend, after her father died on October 1, 2020, according to police.
The couple was arrested on Monday after the victim recorded her statement before a magistrate at a hospital.
On Tuesday, a duty metropolitan magistrate had sent the couple to one-day judicial custody.
Police have registered a case against the couple under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 376(2)(f) (being a relative, guardian or teacher of, or a person in a position of trust or authority towards the woman, commits rape on such woman), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to outrage the modesty of a woman).
Other penal provisions invoked in the case include voluntarily causing hurt, causing miscarriage without a woman's consent and criminal conspiracy.

The court upheld a trial court order which declared the man not guilty of raping his second wife.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has refused to entertain the State's appeal against a man's acquittal in a case of raping his 15-year-old wife, saying his physical relationship with her cannot be termed as rape.
The high court upheld a trial court's judgement which had declared the Muslim man not guilty of raping his second wife, saying he has been rightly acquitted.
“The additional sessions judge had rightly observed that in view of the testimony of the child that she got married to the respondent (man) in the month of December, 2014 and only thereafter did they have physical relationship, no offence under Section 6 read with Section 5(1) of POCSO Act was made out and the respondent was rightly acquitted,” a bench of Justices Suresh Kumar Kait and Neena Bansal Krishna said.
The high court said there was no ground for grant of leave to appeal against the trial court's verdict and dismissed an application filed by the police.
“We find that since the child victim was the wife who was almost fifteen years of age, the physical relationship of the respondent with the victim, cannot be termed as rape. The respondent has been rightly acquitted,” the bench said.
Under the exception given in Section 375 (rape) of the IPC, sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his wife, the wife not being under 15 years, is not rape.
According to the prosecution, a rape case was lodged against the man in 2015 on the complaint of the girl's mother after finding out that her minor daughter was pregnant.
The girl, in her testimony before the trial court, submitted that the man who was her brother-in-law had married her in December 2014 after which he established physical relations with her with her consent and she became pregnant.

Ravinder Kumar was convicted by a Delhi court on May 6
New Delhi:
A man accused of kidnapping, sexually assaulting and then murdering as many as 30 children was sentenced to life imprisonment by a Delhi court today following his conviction in one of the cases against him.
On May 6, the court in Rohini held Ravinder Kumar guilty of kidnapping, sexually assaulting and murdering a six-year-old. The sentencing was to take place last week but was postponed because the court had not received a report on Kumar's income and assets.
Kumar, it is alleged, abused and killed 30 children between 2008 and 2015. He was arrested in 2015 from the Outer Delhi area and a case registered in Begampur police station.
During the arguments on sentencing, Delhi Police had sought maximum punishment for the convict.
Originally from Kasganj in Uttar Pradesh, Kumar came to Delhi in 2008 at the age of 18. Investigation had revealed that he was addicted to porn and drugs. According to police, he worked through the day and lived in a shanty.
Police had told the court that he would look for children after taking drugs and would sometimes walk as much as 40 kilometres. He would go to construction sites and slums where children from underprivileged families often wandered unattended, police said. He would lure children by showing them 10 rupee notes or chocolates. He would then take the children to an isolated place and abuse them before murdering them, police had told court.
According to police, on one occasion, Kumar threw a child into a septic tank.
He was eventually arrested in 2015 from a bus stand in Rohini after police scanned CCTV footage for days to track him down.
Ravinder had allegedly kidnapped a six-year-old girl from Kerala in 2008 and then raped and murdered her. He was not arrested in that case. His later targets were in Delhi-NCR, police said.

The Saket court had recently directed Delhi police to register an FIR within a week. (Representational)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Wednesday stayed the trial court order of registering an FIR against Veer Singh, son of business tycoon and founder of Max group Analjit Singh, in connection with an alleged rape case.
The Saket court had recently directed Delhi police to register an FIR within a week in an alleged case of rape on the pretext of marriage. The order was challenged before the Delhi HC.
Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani stayed the order and issued notice on the plea challenging it. The matter has been listed on May 29, for further hearing.
Delhi's Saket Court's Addition Sessions Judge (ASG) on March 27, passed the direction for registration of the FIR.
The Sessions Court had noted that the sexual relations were prima facie established based on the pretext of marriage. The court had observed that acts of putting vermillion on the head and garlanding each other are sufficient to induce the belief of lawful marriage.
It was submitted by the woman that she was induced to believe that they were lawfully married in 2018, and to cohabit with him and to establish sexual relations. They also had a child out of the relationship.
The woman alleged that the marriage was organised by Singh and his family members in Taiwan in 2018. She also alleged that her movements were obstructed and were followed without her consent. It was further alleged that the CCTV and baby monitors were placed in the bathrooms.
The complainant had sought direction for the registration of FIR. While passing the direction the trial court observed that to ignore the narrated alleged conduct of the accused would be akin to giving licence to 'licentious men' to break the law and exploit the autonomy of a woman with brazen impunity.
The trial court also observed that it was a case where prima facie there are allegations of the commission of sexual intercourse without the consent of the complainant.
It further noted that sexual relations were prima facie established based on the misconception of lawful marriage.
As per the allegations, the respondent disingenuously induced the revisionist to believe that they were lawfully married when they were not so married, then on the basis of this deceit had sexual relations and begotten a child, and then one fine day told the revisionist to pack her bags and left her stranded, the trial court noted.

The top court set aside the high court order and acquitted them of the offences.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court has dismissed petitions seeking review of its verdict acquitting three death row convicts in the gangrape and murder case of a 19-year-old girl in Chhawla area here in 2012.
A bench comprising Chief Justice DY Chandrachud and justices S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi said there is no factual or legal error, apparent on the face of record requiring review of the judgment passed by this court.
Besides the Delhi government, father of the victim, activist Yogita Bhayana, Uttarakhand Bachao Movement and Uttarakhand Lok Manch had sought the review of the judgement.
""After having considered the judgment and other documents on record, we do not find any error either factual or legal, apparent on the face of record requiring review of the aforestated judgment passed by this Court.
""Even if an event, which has no nexus to the instant case had taken place subsequent to the pronouncement of the judgment that would not be a ground to entertain the review petitions,"" the bench said in its March 2 order which was uploaded on Tuesday.
On the plea filed by Bhayana, Uttrakhand Bachao Movement and Uttarakhand Lok Manch, the top court said application at the instance of a person who was not a party to the criminal proceedings is not maintainable.
The top court, on February 8, had agreed to constitute a three-judge bench to consider pleas for a review of its verdict acquitting the three death row convicts in the case.
In 2012, the three accused had allegedly gangraped the girl, murdered her and mutilated her body with a screwdriver and other weapons. The trial court had awarded them a death sentence and the high court upheld it in August 2014.
The top court set aside the high court order and acquitted them of the offences in November last year, sparking a debate on the verdict.
Except the plea seeking review of a judgement awarding death penalty to a convict, such petitions are considered and decided in chambers.

The fresh application was filed by M Harsha Vardhan, deputy commissioner of police of Dwarka district.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court today agreed to constitute a three-judge bench to consider Delhi Police's plea for a review of its verdict acquitting three death row convicts in the gangrape and murder of a 19-year-old girl in Delhi's Chhawla area in 2012.
One of the acquitted recently slit a person's throat, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Delhi Police, told a bench of Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud and Justices P S Narasimha and J B Pardiwala.
""What I am saying is that all these accused who were acquitted are hardened criminals. Therefore, we are seeking review of last year's verdict,"" Mr Mehta said, adding that a three-judge bench headed by then CJI U U Lalit had pronounced the verdict.
Vinod, one of the three acquitted, has been arrested for allegedly killing an auto driver in Delhi's Dwarka area last month.
In 2012, the three accused had gangraped a 19-year-old girl, murdered her and mutilated her body with a screwdriver and other weapons. The trial court awarded them the death sentence and the high court upheld it in August 2014. The top court set aside the high court order and acquitted them of the offences in November last year.
CJI Chandrachud said the court will constitute a bench comprising himself and Justices S Ravindra Bhat and Bela M Trivedi to hear the review plea.
Mr Mehta requested the court to accord an open court hearing on the review plea. To this, the CJI said it is up to the new bench to decide on the matter.
The fresh application was filed by M Harsha Vardhan, deputy commissioner of police of Dwarka district.
""It is important to bring forth before this court that the one of the accused Vinod after being acquitted by this court of the conviction and punishment granted to him for offences of kidnapping, gangrape and murder, has after his release, has committed murder of an innocent auto driver when he resisted robbery attempt by the accused,"" the application said.
An FIR was registered on January 26, 2023 with the Dwarka (North) police station and Vinod arrested following the investigation.
""Commission of murder after his release indicates that the accused is a hardened criminal who has abused the benevolence of this court. The said fact assumes grave importance for adjudication of the present review petition as the act done by the accused Vinod clearly goes on to show that he was indeed a criminal minded person and is in fact a threat to the society as a whole and does not deserve any leniency whatsoever,"" the application said.
On December 8 last year, Delhi Police moved the top court seeking a review of its acquittal verdict, saying the offence was ""diabolic in nature exhibiting grave depravity and bestiality"" and fell under the ""rarest of rare"" category.
Several review pleas, including one filed by the teen's father, against the top court verdict have also been filed.
While acquitting the three convicts, the Supreme Court said the law does not permit courts to punish an accused on the basis of moral conviction or on suspicion alone.
It said the prosecution failed to provide leading, cogent, clinching and clear evidence, including those related to DNA profiling and call detail records (CDRs), against the accused, and said the trial court also acted as a ""passive umpire"".
The body of the 19-year-old, who worked in Cyber Hub, Gurgaon, was found three days after she was abducted. According to the prosecution, she belonged to Uttarakhand and was returning from her workplace.
When she didn't return home, her parents lodged a missing person report, the prosecution said, adding that the woman's mutilated and decomposing body was found in a village in Rewari, Haryana.
The police found multiple injuries on the body. Further investigation and autopsy revealed she was attacked with car tools, glass bottles, metal objects, and other weapons. She was also raped, police said.
Police arrested the three men allegedly involved in the crime and claimed one of them took revenge after the woman spurned his advances.

DCP Dwarka M Harshawardhan told ANI that both the accused have been arrested.
New Delhi:
An auto driver named Anar Singh was stabbed to death by two of his passengers who tried to rob him on the intervening night of January 25-26, the police informed on Saturday.
The two accused have been identified as Pawan and Vinod, the latter of whom was one of three accused in the Chhawla rape case, who was acquitted by the Supreme Court.
DCP Dwarka M Harshawardhan told ANI that both the accused have been arrested.
""An auto driver was stabbed to death in the Dwarka area on the intervening night of 25-26 January by two accused passengers, Pawan and Vinod who tried to rob him. During the probe it was found Vinod was recently acquitted by Supreme Court in the Chhawla rape case,"" he said.
On the Chhawla rape case, DCP said that they have also filed a review petition in the Supreme Court.
""We strongly believe that there is sufficient ground for review of the decision, and we have also filed a review petition in the Supreme Court,"" he added.
The victim's brother Arvind Pal said that if the accused is not given harsh punishment, then other criminals will also lose the fear of the law.
""We came to know that one of the accused who killed my brother had raped and killed a girl in Chhawla in 2012. But the court acquitted him, and then he killed my brother. I want to know, how was he released? I want him to be hanged"", he said.
The accused's cousin Vinay demanded the government to support the victim's children.
""I request the government to provide help to Anar Singh's children. He used to drive an auto for Rs 300 per day, used to live with the family on 7000 rent, and used to eat food only once a day. What will happen to their children now? The court will punish the accused but who will take care of the victim's children?"" he said.
Talking on the matter, the Chhwala rape victim's father told ANI that if the accused would have been hanged earlier, the victim auto driver would have been alive.
""My daughter was kidnapped, raped and killed. It's 11 years to the incident, but I am still fighting the case. The HC sentenced them to death but the SC acquitted them. If the accused who were to be hanged, will be released like this, it will embolden the criminals. If they would have been hanged, then the poor man wouldn't have got killed. I want the accused too be hanged as soon as possible,"" he said.
The Chhawla case pertains to the alleged abduction, gang-rape, and murder of a 19-year-old girl from Uttarakhand's Pauri by three men in the Chhawla area of the national capital's Dwarka on February 9, 2012.
In the said case, the Supreme Court, on November 7, 2022, acquitted the three accused, setting aside the Delhi High Court judgement awarding life sentences to the trio.

The man killed the auto driver after trying to rob him in Delhi, police said. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A man who was freed by the Supreme Court in a rape-murder case nearly three months ago has been arrested again for allegedly killing an auto driver in Delhi.
Vinod was among three men sentenced to death for the rape, torture and killing of a 19-year-old woman in 2012, but was freed by the Supreme Court in November last year. The court said the prosecution ""failed to prove their case"" against the men and gave them ""the benefit of the doubt"".
He and his accomplice killed the auto driver after trying to rob him in Dwarka Sector-13 on January 26. The accused first sat in his auto and then slit his throat, said police.
Police first arrested Pawan, the accomplice, after scanning the security footage around the area. Pawan's questioning led them to Vinod. ""Pawan said he did not know that Vinod was an accused in the Chhawla gang-rape case,"" the police said.
Vinod was arrested on January 29.
The three men were accused of kidnapping, gang-raping and brutally killing the 19-year-old woman in February 2012. Her mutilated body was found three days after she was kidnapped. They were given a death sentence in 2014 by a trial court which termed the case as ""rarest of rare"".
On November 7, the Supreme Court acquitted the three men by setting aside the Delhi High Court's August 26, 2014 order upholding the death sentence awarded by the trial court.

The court had earlier granted interim bail to Kuldeep Singh Sengar for two weeks. (File)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court Friday modified its order granting interim bail to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar, serving life term for raping a minor in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao in 2017, by asking him to surrender after his daughter's 'tilak' ceremony and then be released again before her marriage.
The court had earlier granted interim bail to Kuldeep Singh Sengar for two weeks.
The high court, which was informed that Sengar has been released from Tihar jail this morning, passed the modification order on an application by the victim seeking to recall the interim bail order as she and her family faces threat.
A bench of Justices Mukta Gupta and Poonam A Bamba, which had on January 16 granted interim bail to Sengar from January 27 to February 10 on account of his daughter's marriage, directed that the politician shall surrender before jail authorities on February 1 as the 'tilak' ceremony is scheduled on January 30.
It said Sengar shall be again released from jail on February 6 and surrender on February 10 as the wedding is fixed for February 8.
The victim, who was present in the court, said, ""If Kuldeep Sengar is granted bail, I and the witnesses will be in danger. All the government officials there are his appointees. I request not to release him or else he can get me killed."" Advocate Mehmood Pracha, representing the girl, said the threat perception was also there even when Sengar was in custody and while ordinarily people are released from jail in the evening, the politician has been released early in the morning which shows his clout.
Senior advocate Pramod Dubey, appearing for Sengar, opposed the victim's plea saying the court has imposed sufficient conditions on the leader while granting him the relief and court may ask him to stay in his house instead of reducing the period.
Sengar has been granted interim bail to attend his daughter's marriage in the rape case as well as in the case in which he is serving 10 years' imprisonment for the death of the Unnao rape victim's father in custody.
The victim has sought recall of the January 16 order by which Sengar was granted interim bail in the rape case.
The CBI, which had earlier verified the factum of marriage of Sengar's daughter, told the court in a latest status report that it may reconsider and recall its interim bail order.
Sengar's appeal challenging the trial court's verdict in the Unnao rape case is pending in the high court. He has sought quashing of the December 2019 judgement of the trial court which sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.
The girl was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.
On March 13, 2020, Sengar was sentenced to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment, besides imposition of a fine of Rs 10 lakh, in the case of death of the rape victim's father in custody. The court had also awarded a 10-year jail term to Sengar's brother Atul Singh Sengar and five others.
The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Sengar in a case under the Arms Act and died in custody on April 9, 2018.
The trial court, which did not hold the accused guilty of murder under the IPC, awarded the maximum sentence for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder to the convicts under section 304 of the IPC after holding that there was no intention to kill.
The case was transferred to Delhi from the trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1, 2019.

Kuldeep Singh Sengar has been granted interim bail to attend his daughter's wedding. (File)
New Delhi:
Delhi High Court on Wednesday sought the response of the CBI and expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who is serving a life term for raping a minor girl in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao in 2017, on a plea by the victim seeking cancellation of his interim bail.
Kuldeep Singh Sengar has been granted interim bail to attend his daughter's wedding. His sentence has been suspended from January 27 to February 10 in the rape case and in another for which he is serving 10 years' imprisonment for the death of the rape victim's father in custody.
A bench of Justice Mukta Gupta and Justice Anoop Mendiratta issued the notice on the victim's application and listed it for further hearing on January 27, when Sengar is scheduled to be released from jail.
The victim, who was present in court, submitted in her application that there is a threat perception to her and her family and she has received information that Kuldeep Singh Sengar is allegedly likely to harm them after being released.
Advocate Mehmood Pracha, representing the victim, claimed that the CBI has suppressed from the court certain facts, including that the Uttar Pradesh government filed an affidavit before the Supreme Court on November 16, 2022, in which the security risk to the girl and her family during Kuldeep Singh Sengar's incarceration has been highlighted.
""Hence, the security risk to the applicant (victim) upon the enlargement of the appellant (Sengar), even for an interim period, poses a serious risk,"" the lawyer said.
He argued that the victim's apprehension regarding her and her family's safety has increased, especially when the convict is permitted to use his mobile phone.
The victim has sought recall of the January 16 order by which Kuldeep Singh Sengar was granted interim bail in the rape case.
The CBI's counsel told the court that Kuldeep Singh Sengar has not yet been released and he will be out on January 27.
The counsel for the CBI said a status report has been filed by the agency and it was found that two halls have been booked for the wedding ceremonies.
The high court was told that the 'sagan' ceremony of the expelled leader's daughter is scheduled for January 18 and the marriage fixed for February 8.
Kuldeep Singh Sengar's appeal challenging the trial court's verdict in the Unnao rape case is pending in the high court. He has sought quashing of the December 2019 judgment of the trial court which sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.
The girl was kidnapped and raped by Kuldeep Singh Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.
On March 13, 2020, Kuldeep Singh Sengar was sentenced to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment, besides imposition of a fine of Rs 10 lakh, in the case of death of the rape victim's father in custody. The court had also awarded a 10-year jail term to Kuldeep Singh Sengar's brother Atul Singh Sengar and five others.
The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Kuldeep Singh Sengar in a case under Arms Act and died in custody on April 9, 2018.
The trial court, which did not hold the accused guilty of murder under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), awarded the maximum sentence for culpable homicide not amounting to murder to the convicts under section 304 of the IPC after holding that there was no intention to kill.
The case was transferred to Delhi from the trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1, 2019.

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court today granted interim bail to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar, serving 10 years' imprisonment for the death of the Unnao rape survivor's father in custody, to attend his daughter's wedding.
Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma suspended the sentence from January 27 to February 10 and said a division bench of the high court has already granted interim relief to Sengar, and sufficient conditions have been imposed on him.

During the hearing, the rape survivor's sister, who was present in the court, opposed the plea for interim release.

Sengar's appeal challenging the trial court's verdict in the Unnao rape case is pending in the high court. He has sought quashing of the December 2019 judgement of the trial court which sentenced him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Monday granted interim bail to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who is serving life term for raping a minor girl in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao in 2017, to enable him to attend the wedding of his daughter.
A bench of Justices Mukta Gupta and Poonam A Bamba suspended the sentence from January 27 to February 10 and asked Sengar to report to the SHO concerned on a daily basis during his release period and furnish two sureties of Rs 1 lakh each.
Kuldeep Singh Sengar, represented by senior advocates N Hariharan and P K Dubey, informed the court that wedding rituals and ceremonies would be held in Gorakhpur and Lucknow and being the only male family member, he has to make arrangements.
Sengar had earlier informed the court that the wedding would take place on February 8.
Counsel for the CBI said that a status report has been filed by the agency and it was found that two halls have been booked for the wedding ceremonies.
Sengar's appeal challenging the trial court's verdict in the Unnao rape case is already pending in the high court.
He has sought quashing of the December 16, 2019, judgement of the trial court which convicted him. Sengar has also sought setting aside of the December 20, 2019 order sentencing him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.
The trial court had convicted Sengar under various provisions, including section 376 (2) of the IPC which deals with the offence of rape committed by a public servant who ""takes advantage of his official position and commits rape on a woman in his custody as such public servant or in the custody of a public servant subordinate to him"".
It had awarded him the maximum punishment of life term with a rider that the convict will remain in jail for the ""remainder of his natural biological life"" and also imposed an fine of Rs 25 lakh on him.
The girl was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.
The trial, which started on August 5, 2019, after it was transferred from Unnao to Delhi on the Supreme Court's directions, was carried on a day-to-day basis.
The apex court, taking cognisance of the rape survivor's letter written to the then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had on August 1, 2019, transferred all five cases registered in connection with the Unnao rape incident from a Lucknow court to the court in Delhi with directions to hold trial on a daily basis and complete it within 45 days.

IAS officer Sanjeev Hans and former MLA Gulab have been accused of gang rape at gunpoint of a woman.

Patna:
A Bihar court on Sunday ordered the Patna police to register a rape case against senior IAS officer Sanjeev Hans and former RJD MLA Gulab Yadav in connection with the alleged rape of a woman at a Delhi hotel in 2021.
IAS officer Sanjeev Hans and former MLA Gulab have been accused of gang rape at gunpoint of a woman.
After hearing the petition filed by the victim's lawyer, the Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate (ACJM) of Danapur Civil Court has ordered the registration of a rape case against both of them.
It is said that the woman had filed this petition in the year 2021 after which the bench sought a preliminary inquiry report on the matter from the Patna police. Still, the report was not submitted failing which the court dismissed the case.
The victim then challenged the order of the ACJM in the Patna High Court. The High Court ordered a re-hearing of the case and said in its ruling that on the complaint of the rape victim, the Patna Police has to present the preliminary investigation report of the matter to ACJM Danapur Court. The court has also noticed the apathy of the Patna Police in this matter.
On the order of the High Court, the hearing started again in the Danapur court. At the same time, in the investigation of the police, it has come to know that officers Sanjeev Hans and Gulab Yadav were present in a hotel in Delhi along with the victim woman.
According to the information, the complainant in her complaint to Patna Police in 2021 alleged that the MLA Gulab Yadav had tempted her to make her a member of the Women's Commission. One day MLA Yadav called her to his flat in Rukanpura, Patna. During this, the MLA raped her and also made a video of her.
After this the MLA started blackmailing her, the victim said.
The woman said that Gulab Yadav blackmailed her threatening to make the obscene video viral and called her to a hotel in Delhi, where IAS officer Sanjeev Hans was also present. Both of them carried out the incident of rape with her at gunpoint.
The complainant's advocate Ranjan Kumar Sharma alleged that in 2021 both of them had done this.
The victim's lawyer said that Gulab Yadav was RJD's MLA from the Jhanjharpur assembly at that time and Sanjeev Hans was serving as the IAS officer in Patna.
Advocate Ranjan Kumar Sharma said that the complainant gave several written complaints to the Patna Police in 2021 for registering an FIR but due to the high profile case, the police remained silent and did not take any action. Then she had requested to register an FIR in the court of ACJM of Danapur but it was dismissed there also on the ground that the police have not submitted the reports, the advocate said.
""Now after receiving the orders from Patna High court the ACJM of Danapur Civil Court has ordered to register a rape case against both IAS officer Sanjeev Hans and MLA Gulab Yadav,"" he added.

The trial court sentenced Kuldeep Singh Sengar to 10 years rigorous imprisonment.
New Delhi:
Delhi High Court on Thursday asked the CBI to respond to expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar's plea seeking interim release in a case related to the custodial death of the Unnao rape victim's father for which he is serving 10 years in prison.
Justice Dinesh Kumar Sharma directed the agency to file a report on or before January 16, the next date of hearing, on Sengar's application for interim bail and suspension of sentence on account of his daughter's wedding.
The CBI counsel informed the judge that Sengar had filed a similar plea before a division bench of the high court in another case in which he is serving a life term for raping a minor in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao in 2017.
The division bench has already issued a notice to the CBI on the plea and listed it for a hearing on January 16.
The 'sagan' ceremony of Sengar's daughter is scheduled on January 18 and the wedding has been fixed for February 8, said advocate Kanhaiya Singhal, appearing for the leader.
The high court was informed that Sengar was seeking interim bail for two months to attend the wedding ceremonies, which would begin on January 18.
Sengar's appeal challenging the trial court's verdict in the Unnao rape case is already pending in the high court.
He has sought quashing of the December 16, 2019, judgment of the trial court that convicted him in the rape case. Sengar has also sought to set aside of the December 20, 2019, order sentencing him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.
The girl was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.
On March 13, 2020, the trial court sentenced Sengar to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on him in the case of the victim's father's death in custody. The trial court had said ""no leniency"" could be shown for killing a family's ""sole bread earner"".
It had also ordered 10 years in jail to Sengar's brother Atul Singh Sengar and five others for their role in the custodial killing of the rape victim's father.
The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Sengar under the Arms Act and died in custody on April 9, 2018, owing to police brutalities.
The trial court, which did not hold the accused guilty of murder, awarded the convicts maximum sentence for culpable homicide not amounting to murder under Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) after holding that there was no intention to kill.
Besides 10 years in prison for culpable homicide, Sengar, his brother, the-then in-charge of Makhi police station Unnao Ashok Singh Bhadauria and then sub-inspectors KP Singh, Vineet Mishra, Birendra Singh and Shashi Pratap Singh were sentenced for other offences as well.
The case was transferred to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the Supreme Court's directions on August 1, 2019.

New Delhi:
The Delhi man caught on security camera footage last week kidnapping a four-year-old girl who he later raped and abandoned near a park was arrested late on Monday night, police said. The accused, identified as Anil Pathak, is being questioned, while the girl is reportedly fighting for her life at a hospital.
The crime was reported from Bhalswa Dairy area in outer-north Delhi on Wednesday. Police said Anil Pathak kidnapped the girl, daughter of daily wage labourers, from outside her house where she was playing.
Security camera footage from the area showed the accused carrying the girl in his arms.
The victim's parents filed a missing complaint when she didn't return home by night. She was found near a park in the area early the next morning, officials said, adding that she was rushed to a hospital for a medical examination, where doctors confirmed that she was raped.
Police had formed three teams to trace the child, and her photograph was shared with other police stations as well. Announcements were also made in the area about her.
Devesh Kumar Mahla, Deputy Commissioner of Police, outer-north Delhi, said the search continued throughout the night and the child was found near a park at 7 am on Thursday.
A case was registered against the accused under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act for rape and abduction of the minor girl.
The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) also sought a report from the police in the case.
""Five-year-old girl raped in Delhi. She was picked up from the front of her residence at Bhalswa Dairy and, later, found near a lake. She underwent a surgery in a hospital. My team is with her. We have issued a notice to the Delhi Police so that the accused are arrested soon,"" DCW chief Swati Maliwal tweeted in Hindi.

Delhi High Court Grants Protection To Unnao Rape Survivor In Forgery Case

The next hearing in the case is scheduled for March 1, 2023. (File)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has granted interim protection from ""precipitate action"" to the 2017 Unnao rape survivor in an FIR registered by the Uttar Pradesh police for allegedly forging her date of birth to attract provisions of the POCSO Act in the case in which the now expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar was convicted.
Sengar has since been disqualified as an MLA.
Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani issued notice on the anticipatory bail plea by the 21-year-old and directed that subject to the petitioner appearing before the trial court when required, ""no precipitate action affecting the petitioner's liberty shall be taken by the trial court, till the next date of hearing"".
The court, in a recent order, granted six weeks to the prosecution to file a status report and listed the case for further hearing on March 1.
The FIR was registered by Makhi police station in Unnao on December 23, 2018 under sections 419/420/467/468/471 IPC for the alleged offence of cheating and forgery after the husband of an accused in the main rape case claimed the petitioner and her mother forged the date on the birth certificate so they could press the charge under the POCSO Act.
In her anticipatory bail plea, the petitioner said a charge-sheet has been filed but due to threat to her life, she could not appear in response to the summons and, consequently, non-bailable warrants were issued against her.
The petitioner, represented by lawyers Mehmood Pracha and Jatin Bhatt, claimed while there is ""absolutely nothing against her in the investigation"", she was apprehending arrest upon her appearance before the trial court here.
""There is no allegation of participation, conspiracy, or knowledge against the Petitioner, and has been included in the case solely as a measure of harassment at the behest of the erstwhile MLA,"" the plea alleged. Sengar's appeal challenging the trial court's verdict in the Unnao rape case is pending in the high court.
He has sought the quashing of the December 16, 2019 judgement of the trial court which convicted him of rape. Sengar has also sought setting aside of the December 20, 2019 order sentencing him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.
The trial court had convicted Sengar under various provisions including section 376 (2) of IPC which deals with the offence of rape committed by a public servant who ""takes advantage of his official position and commits rape on a woman in his custody as such public servant or in the custody of a public servant subordinate to him"".
It had awarded him the maximum punishment of life term with a rider that the convict will remain in jail for the ""remainder of his natural biological life"" and also imposed an exemplary fine of Rs 25 lakh on him.
The girl was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was stated to be a minor. The trial, which started on August 5, 2019, after it was transferred from Unnao to Delhi on the Supreme Court's directions, was carried on a day-to-day basis.
The Supreme Court, taking cognizance of the rape survivor's letter written to the then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had on August 1, 2019 transferred all five cases registered in connection with the Unnao rape incident from a Lucknow court in Uttar Pradesh to the court in Delhi with a direction to hold trial on a daily basis and complete it within 45 days.

Delhi High Court has granted bail to a 20-year-old man in a rape and POCSO case. (Representational)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has granted bail to a 20-year-old man in a rape and POCSO case arising out of ""juvenile romance"" while noting that the girl herself offered to stand as ""surety"" for him for his release.
While dealing with the bail plea of the boy in the FIR registered at the insistence of the girl's mother, Justice Anup Jairam Bhambhani said that prima-facie, there was a consensual physical relationship between the petitioner and the girl who were 18 and 17 years old, respectively, at the relevant time.
The petitioner's lawyer argued that it was a case of juvenile romance and the girl 'X' - who is now a major - regards the petitioner as her husband and wished to live with him.
The judge directed the release of the petitioner, who was in custody for over 22 months, on personal bond of Rs10,000 with two local sureties and said this was a ""sui-generis"" case as ""X has even offered to stand 'surety' for the petitioner if he is admitted to bail, since it would appear that 'X' would perhaps be the only local surety available to the petitioner, who otherwise hails from Bihar"".
The FIR under sections 363 (Punishment for kidnapping)/366 (Kidnapping, abducting or inducing woman to compel her marriage)/376 (Punishment for rape) IPC and section 6 (Punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act) was registered after X's mother reported that she had gone missing.
In the order dated December 21, the court recorded that admittedly, X has borne a child with the petitioner and is currently living with his parents and she has ""consistently maintained"" that she had accompanied him by her own free volition and got married to him.
The court further said that at the relevant time, X was ""at the cusp of majority, being about 17 years, 08 months old"" and after interacting with her in person, it ""found that X completely and wholeheartedly endorses and affirms"" her stand.
It thus opined that the circumstances of the case favoured grant of bail to the petitioner and ordered, ""Accordingly, the petition is allowed; and the petitioner is admitted to regular bail during the pendency of the trial.""

Kuldeep Sengar is serving life term for raping a minor girl in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao in 2017.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Thursday sought the stand of the CBI on a plea by expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar seeking interim release in a case in which he is serving life term for raping a minor girl in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao in 2017.
A bench of Justices Mukta Gupta and Poonam A Bamba issued notice on Sengar's application for interim bail and suspension of sentence on account of his daughter's wedding ceremony, and asked the investigating agency to file a status report.
“Notice…The application be verified and a status report be filed,” said the court which listed the matter for further hearing on January 16.
Senior counsel, appearing for Sengar, said while the marriage will take place on February 8, a ceremony related to it will be held in January.
Justice Talwant Singh, while sitting as part of a division bench, had earlier recused himself from hearing the matter.
The high court was then informed that Sengar was seeking interim bail for two months to attend the ceremonies which would begin on January 18.
Kuldeep Sengar's appeal challenging the trial court's verdict in the Unnao rape case is already pending in the high court.
He has sought quashing of the December 16, 2019, judgement of the trial court which convicted him. Sengar has also sought setting aside of the December 20, 2019 order sentencing him to imprisonment for the remainder of his life.
The trial court had convicted Sengar under various provisions including section 376 (2) of the IPC which deals with the offence of rape committed by a public servant who ""takes advantage of his official position and commits rape on a woman in his custody as such public servant or in the custody of a public servant subordinate to him"".
It had awarded him the maximum punishment of life term with a rider that the convict will remain in jail for the ""remainder of his natural biological life"" and also imposed an exemplary fine of Rs 25 lakh on him.
The girl was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.
The trial, which started on August 5, 2019, after it was transferred from Unnao to Delhi on the Supreme Court's directions, was carried on a day-to-day basis.

Expelled Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar moved a plea before the Delhi High court seeking interim bail for his daughter's wedding in February 2023. Sengar is a convict in a minor's rape case in Unnao.
He was convicted and awarded a life sentence in 2017.
A division bench comprising justices Sidharth Mridul and Talwant Singh listed the matter before another bench of which justice Talwant Singh won't be a member.

The bench comprising Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar issued notice to CBI and the victim in the case.
Advocate N Hariharan submitted before the bench that the petitioner has been long incarcerated in this case and that he has been in jail for the last four years.
The bench asked about the sentence in this case. To which Hariharan submitted that the petitioner is awarded a life sentence. He argued that the gravity of this case was enhanced the moment POCSO was invoked. Though the reality is that the victim was not a minor on the day of the incident.

Today is the 10th anniversary of the gruesome rape and murder of Nirbhaya.
New Delhi:
We are still in 2012, Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi, who was out in the streets in Delhi's Dwarka demanding safety and justice for women in the national capital, told NDTV. Today is the 10th anniversary of the gruesome rape and murder of Nirbhaya, which shook the country and triggered strict new legislation dealing with crime against women.
""10 years have passed. If women were safe, everyone got justice and could get reports files easily, then we would not have stood here on the road with placards,"" she said when asked if things have improved in the last decade.
Citing examples of an acid attack on a young girl in Delhi two days ago, and another woman who was chopped into pieces, she requested the government and the Supreme Court to ensure justice.
She also referred to the 2012 rape and killing of a 19-year-old woman in Delhi's Chhawala area, where the rapists and killers were recently set free by the Supreme Court, and said it was an example ""that women in the country are not safe, and aren't getting justice"". 
The Arvind Kejriwal-led Delhi government has said it will challenge the Supreme Court's order acquitting the three convicts in this case.
In the Supreme Court, the Delhi Police cited the heinous nature of the crime and argued against any concession whatsoever to the convicts.
A lot of mothers whose daughters were killed are with us here, who are going from court to court, she said, pointing to a group of women who reportedly joined her in hopes to get justice for their children too.
""They have hope in me that I can get them justice, so I request the government and the Supreme Court, on the occasion of 10 years of Nirbhaya being murdered, that they grant justice to our country's girls. Fix your security arrangements. We are in Delhi, and not safe here as well. We are still in 2012,"" she said.
Protesters who joined her also said that most people aren't aware of strict legislation, and even the Nirbhaya fund, brought in after the gruesome 2012 rape-murder and that women still fear venturing out of their homes after 9 pm in the national capital.

Delhi-based YouTuber Namra Qadir has been arrested for allegedly extorting more than Rs 80 lakh from a private firm's owner after honey-trapping and threatening to implicate him in a rape case, police said on Tuesday.  
She wT
Qadir's husband and co-accused Manish alias Virat Beniwal is at large, police said, adding that raids are being conducted to apprehend him. Twenty-two-year-old Qadir has more than 617k subscribers on the video-sharing platform.
Dinesh Yadav (21), a resident of Badshahpur, had lodged a complaint in August but the couple went to court for interim bail, police in Gurugram said.
It was only after their interim bail was cancelled that an FIR was registered on November 26 at the Sector-50 police station against them, they said, and added that Qadir and Beniwal are residents of Shalimar Bagh in Delhi.
""Qadir has confessed to the crime and we have taken her on police remand to recover the money and other items that were taken by her from the victim under alleged pressure.

The court denied bail to a man accused of raping a 16-year-old girl.
New Delhi:
Consent of a minor is not consent in the eyes of law, Delhi High Court has observed while denying bail to a man accused of raping a 16-year-old girl and also getting her date of birth changed on her Aadhaar card.
The high court also said the conduct of the man in getting the girl's date of birth changed on the Aadhaar card was a ""serious offence"".
""It seems that the applicant (man) wanted to take advantage by getting the date of birth on the Aadhaar card changed so that when the applicant established physical relationship with the complainant, she was not a minor.
""The consent of the minor at the age of 16 years, specially, when the applicant was 23 years old and already married also disentitles him for grant of bail. Consent of a minor is no consent in the eyes of law,"" Justice Jasmeet Singh said in a recent order.
An FIR was lodged in 2019 on the complaint of the girl's father that his daughter was missing. Later, the girl was traced and rescued from Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal district and brought back.
The girl, who was found in the company of the man, said in her statement before a magistrate that he was her boyfriend and she stayed with him for about one and a half months.
She further said the man established physical relationships with her consent and that she wanted to stay with him.
The man sought bail on grounds that he had been in custody since 2019 and the chargesheet filed.
The judge said, ""In the present case, I am of the view that the girl was merely 16 years on the date of incident. The applicant was 23 years old and was already married. It is stated by... counsel appearing for the complainant (girl) that she has interacted with the complainant and the complainant has informed her that it was the applicant who took her to the office of SDM (subdivisional magistrate) and got her date of birth changed in the Aadhaar card from the year 2002 to March 5, 2000 only for the purpose of showing that the date of the establishing physical relationship she was not a minor.""

New Delhi:
The father of the 19-year-old girl, gang-raped and murdered in Delhi's Chhawla area in 2012, moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking a review of its November 7 verdict by which it had acquitted three men, who were earlier sentenced to death.
The top court had acquitted the three men by setting aside the Delhi High Court's August 26, 2014 order upholding the death sentence awarded by the trial court.
The review plea said, “It is respectfully submitted that this Court has erred in observing that the case being purely dependent upon the circumstantial evidences, the prosecution failed to prove the circumstances beyond reasonable doubt and failed to prove the identity of the accused persons, the circumstances pertaining to the arrest of the accused persons and the seizure of the car used in the crime…”.
It said the top court has also erred in holding that the prosecution has failed to prove the circumstances pertaining to the discovery of the body of the deceased victim, the discovery and seizure of incriminating articles at the scene of the incident and from other places at the instance of accused persons, and the forensic evidence linking the accused persons with the crime.
“It is respectfully submitted that there is an error apparent on the face of record as this Court has erred in not appreciating and examining the testimonies of material witnesses which only direct towards the guilt of the accused persons/ Respondents and are incompatible with the innocence of the accused persons/ Respondents,” it said.
The father of the deceased girl said in his review plea that ""grave injustice"" would be caused to the victim, her parents, and the society in case the accused are allowed to walk free despite ""strong circumstances"" pointing towards their guilt which have been duly proved beyond reasonable doubt.
“The chain of evidence against the accused persons comprising the circumstantial evidence is complete and points towards the guilt and involvement of the accused persons...”, it said.
The plea added other evidence brought on record and testimonies of various prosecution witnesses also form a complete chain of circumstances which only point towards the guilt of the accused.
“Absence of Certificate under Section 65B only pertains to the CDRs of the deceased victim whose location is not in dispute as she was kidnapped from Tajpur, Delhi and her dead body was found in Haryana and not the CDRs of the accused persons”, the plea said.
It added no explanation was provided by the accused in relation to their location matching with the location of the deceased victim at the relevant time.
“The CDRs in the present case are substantial and important pieces of documents which clearly show the similarity in the location of the accused persons and the victim at the time of incident and ought not to be thrown out on the basis of procedural defect and that too in absence of any objection at the time of trial,” the review plea said.
It added there is no motive attributable to the investigation agency to implicate these three particular accused persons in the present case.
“In view of the facts, it is expedient in the interest of justice that the present Review Petition may be heard and allowed,” it said.
On November 7, the top court while acquitting the three convicts had said the law does not permit courts to punish an accused on the basis of moral conviction or on suspicion alone.
It had made the observation while noting that a kind of agony and frustration may be caused to the society in general and to the family of the victim in particular if the accused involved in the heinous crime go unpunished or are acquitted.
It, however, said the prosecution failed to provide leading, cogent, clinching and clear evidence, including those related to DNA profiling and call detail records (CDRs), against the accused, and said the trial court also acted as a “passive umpire”.
The three men were accused of abducting, gang-raping and brutally killing the 19-year-old woman in February 2012.
Her mutilated body was found three days after she was abducted.
In 2014, a trial court awarded death penalty to the three accused, terming the case “rarest of rare”.
According to the prosecution, the woman worked in Gurgaon's Cyber City area and belonged to Uttarakhand. She was returning from her workplace and was near her home when the three men abducted her in a car.
When she didn't return home, her parents lodged a missing person report, the prosecution said, adding the woman's mutilated and decomposing body was found in a village in Rewari, Haryana.
The police found multiple injuries on the woman's body. Further investigation and autopsy revealed she was attacked with car tools, glass bottles, metal objects, and other weapons. She was also raped, they said.
Police arrested the three men allegedly involved in the crime and claimed one of them took revenge after the woman spurned his advances.

A search is on to arrest the accused (Representational)
Gurugram:
A Youtuber couple based in Delhi haven booked for allegedly extorting over Rs 80 lakh from a 21-year-old businessman after honey trapping him and threatening to implicate him in a false rape case, police said on Saturday.
The victim, who runs an advertisement agency, had filed a complaint in August but the couple moved court for an interim bail. Their petition was quashed recently, following which an FIR was registered against them at Sector 50 police station on Thursday.
The complainant, a resident of Badshahpur here, said he got in touch with a woman named Naamra Qadir, a resident of Shalimar Bagh in Delhi, to discuss work sometime ago at a star hotel on Sohna road.
A person named Virat alias Manish Beniwal had tagged along with Qadir.
The complainant said he paid Rs 2.50 lakh to Qadir for business purposes, but when he asked her for the output, she proposed to him for marriage.
They became friends thereafter, police said quoting the complainant.
The complainant said he spent nights with Qadir and Virat, and the couple recorded their private moments, based on which they began blackmailing him.
He said Qadir threatened that she would file a rape case against him and extorted more than Rs 80 lakh.
The police served a notice to the couple on October 10, but they moved the court in Gurugram court for interim bail, which was dismissed on November 18.
They were booked under sections 388 (extortion by putting any person in fear), 328 (causing hurt by mean of poison), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 506 (criminal intimidation), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code at Sector 50 police station on Thursday, Station House Officer Rajesh Kumar said.
""We are conducting raids to nab the accused and they will be arrested soon,"" he said.

The family has alleged that they received death threats inside the courtroom
New Delhi:
The family members of a 19-year-old woman who was gang-raped and murdered by three men in 2012 have requested the Delhi Police to provide security, saying they have been threatened after the Supreme Court yesterday ordered the men to be released.
The three, Ravi Kumar, Rahul and Vinod, were held guilty and sentenced to death by the trial court in 2014. The Delhi High Court upheld the death sentence, likening the men to ""predators"" trawling the streets ""hunting for prey"". Yesterday, the Supreme Court said the prosecution ""failed to prove their case"" against the men and gave them ""the benefit of the doubt"".
In their request to the Delhi Police, the family alleged the three men threatened to kill them inside the courtroom.
Delhi Police sources said they will take a call on providing security based on a threat assessment, which they are currently doing.
The police are also preparing to file a review with the Supreme Court.
A large number of people showed up at the family's home today to show support.
The order by a Supreme Court bench led by then Chief Justice UU Lalit said the prosecution failed to prove the charges against the three men ""beyond reasonable doubt"" and the court acted like a ""passive umpire"" while convicting them.
The identity of the accused was not established by the prosecution, the Supreme Court said, pointing to what it called ""glaring lapses"" in the trial. Of 49 witnesses, 10 were not cross-examined in the trial, the court pointed out.
""Courts should strictly decide cases on merits in accordance with law. Courts should not be influenced by any kind of outside moral pressures or otherwise,"" the Supreme Court said. Justice Ravindra Bhat and Justice Bela M Trivedi were the two other judges on the bench.
The incident took place months before the gang-rape and killing of a 23-year-old student by five men on a moving bus in Delhi, which triggered nationwide protests, worldwide outrage and sweeping changes to the laws on sexual crimes.
In February 2012, the young woman's mutilated and burnt body was found in a field in Haryana's Rewari district, days after she was kidnapped. Severe wounds suggested that she was hit with car tools and earthen pots.
It was revealed during investigations that acid was poured in the woman's eyes and a bottle of liquor was inserted in her private parts.
The three challenged the Delhi High Court ruling in Supreme Court, asking that their sentence be reduced. In the Supreme Court, the Delhi Police had opposed reducing the death sentence. They had said the crime was committed not only against the victim, but also against society.

The convicts' defense had cited their age, family background and past criminal record to argue that their sentence should be reduced.
Following the Supreme Court verdict, the parents of the girl said they were ""broken"" by the judgment but asserted that they would continue their legal fight. ""We came here for justice. This is a blind justice system.""

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court today acquitted three convicts who were awarded the death penalty by a Delhi court after being held guilty of raping and killing a 19-year-old woman in Delhi's Chhawala area in 2012.
The victim's mutilated body was found in a field, with multiple injuries due to assault with objects ranging from car tools to earthen pots.
A Delhi court in February 2014 convicted three men for raping and killing a 19-year-old woman in 2012 and awarded them the death penalty.
The capital punishment was confirmed by the Delhi High Court on August 26, 2014, saying they were ""predators"" moving on the streets and ""were looking for prey"".
Three men, Ravi Kumar, Rahul and Vinod were convicted under various charges dealing with kidnapping, rape and murder.
The case dates back to February 2012, when a 19-year old girl's body was found in Haryana. The girl was brutally killed after being raped.
A case was registered regarding this at outer Delhi's Chhawala (Najafgarh) police station.
According to the prosecution, the offence was brutal in nature as they first kidnapped the woman, raped her, killed her and dumped her body in a field in Rodhai village in Haryana's Rewari district.

A case was registered at Alipur police station against the accused. (representational)
New Delhi:
The police have arrested a 27-year-old man and his brother wanted in separate cases of kidnapping and rape, officials said today.
The accused have been identified as Ashish Chauhan (27) and Deepak Chauhan (23), both residents of Gautam Buddh Nagar in Uttar Pradesh, they said.
On August 29, 2017, Ashish along with his associates had kidnapped a man at gun point from GT Karnal Road and demanded a ransom of Rs 3 crore, police said.
Ashish was traced but he opened fire along with his associates at the police team when they went to nab him. Ashish and his associate Aryan, who was injured in the encounter, were arrested, a senior police officer said.
A case was registered at Alipur police station. Ashish was granted bail on November 3, 2020, but he failed to appear in court proceedings later following which a non-bailable warrant was issued against him, the officer said.
In 2021, Ashish's younger brother Deepak allegedly raped a girl and had been running away in that case. The police found out that Deepak, Ashish and sister had also threatened the victim, police said.
During investigation, the police arrested Ashish from New Ashok Nagar area. They found that Ashish's younger brother Deepak was also running away in a rape case registered at a police station in Noida. The police then arrested Deepak from Golf Course Road in Dwarka, Special Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ravndra Singh Yadav said.
Police said Deepak was working at a call centre at Noida and had sexually assaulted a girl who was his co-worker. After a case was registered, he left Noida and started living in Delhi, they added.

New Delhi:
A 36-year-old woman who claimed she was raped by five men was discharged from the Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital here on Saturday, according to hospital authorities.
The woman came to the hospital at 7:15 am on October 18 and her medico-legal case (MLC) was made and it was kept confidential, they said.
When the woman reached the hospital, her vitals were stable, the GTB Hospital said in a statement.
""She was investigated and treated as per hospital protocols and all formalities were completed.
""She has been discharged on October 22 and the patient's condition was stable at the time of discharge,"" it said.
The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) said the woman told its counsellor that she was gang-raped by five men for two days in Ghaziabad and they inserted an iron rod into her private parts. She claimed that she was tied and dumped on a roadside in a sack.
However, Ghaziabad police on Friday registered a case against the woman and three others, alleging that she levelled the ""fabricated"" gang-rape charge in an attempt to grab property.
DCW chief Swati Maliwal on Saturday wrote to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and urged him to set up a high-level committee to probe the alleged gangrape of a 36-year-old woman in Ghaziabad.
She also said that strong action should be taken against the woman if her allegations are found to be false.

Ghaziabad Gang-Rape: Three men were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police yesterday.
New Delhi:
A Delhi woman's alleged gang-rape and torture in Ghaziabad has turned out to be a story ""cooked up"" to frame some men in a property feud, the police claim. The woman allegedly also paid some associates to ""publicise"" the case.
Three men were arrested by the Uttar Pradesh police yesterday. They allegedly helped the woman fake her kidnapping and assault.
The case was amplified by a video post by Delhi Commission for Woman chief Swati Maliwal, who alleged that the 36-year-old was found wrapped in a jute bag, her hands and legs tied, and an iron rod still inside her. She also said the woman was fighting for her life after being tortured for two days by her ""kidnappers"".
Swati Maliwal had likened the case to that of Nirbhaya, the 23-year-old paramedic who died in 2012 after being gang-raped and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus.
The police never confirmed these details. However, while arresting four of the five people named by the woman, they referred to a property dispute.
Doctors at GTB hospital, where the woman was taken, also denied she had any internal injury, as claimed by Ms Maliwal.
The police say investigations have revealed that the woman spent the two days that she was missing with her friends.
""She was with two of her friends for the two days - the duration for which she'd alleged she'd been kidnapped and raped by five men,"" said Praveen Kumar, UP's regional police chief, on Thursday.
Phone signals revealed that one of her friends had switched off his phone right at the spot where she was found, near Ashram Road that connects Ghaziabad with Delhi.
""We have recovered the car in which she went with her friends and stayed with them for two days,"" Mr Kumar claimed.
The woman had claimed she was kidnapped at gunpoint when waiting for a bus for Delhi after attending a birthday party in Ghaziabad. Her brother had dropped her off at the bus stand, she had said, from where five men in a car dragged her into it and raped her in captivity.
""The complaint was all a conspiracy hatched to file a rape case on the five men,"" the police officer said.
""Evidence has also been found that one of them gave money to a person through PayTM to give more publicity to the rape case,"" the officer added. That friend already has three criminal cases registered against him.
On Wednesday, when she was found, she was first taken to a government hospital in Ghaziabad; then asked to move to Meerut. She refused to go through a medical examination at both the places, the police said.
On her insistence, she was admitted to GTB Hospital in Delhi, police said.
Swati Maliwal has yet to respond to the dramatic twist in the case.

Four of the five accused have been arrested, police said. (File)
New Delhi/Ghaziabad:
A woman from Delhi was in hospital Wednesday after being allegedly raped by five men for two days in Ghaziabad, an incident that Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal said reminds her of the Nirbhaya case.
Swati Maliwal also claimed that the 36-year-old woman was found wrapped in a jute bag, with her hands and legs tied, and an iron rod was inserted in her private parts.
Police said there was a property dispute between the woman and the accused.
Four of the five accused have been arrested, police said.
Authorities at the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital said the woman's condition is stable and no internal injury has been found yet.
Sources at the hospital, however, said there were signs of sexual assault and a ""foreign object"" was found in her body.
The DCW has also issued a notice to Ghaziabad police in connection with the case.
According to Nipun Agarwal, Superintendent of Police (City-I) Ghaziabad, the Nandgram police station received a call on October 18, informing that a woman was lying on the Ashram road.
The police took her to a nearby hospital but she insisted on getting admitted to a hospital in Delhi. She was then taken to the GTB Hospital, he said.
In her statement to the police, the woman said she had been to Ghaziabad to celebrate her brother's birthday, a day before the incident.
The SP said the victim's brother dropped her back and some people, who were known to her, picked her up from there.
The woman has alleged that she was forced to get into the car at gunpoint.
""Four of them have been arrested. Preliminary investigation has revealed that there is a property dispute between the woman and the accused. That case is already in Karkardooma court. The matter is being investigated,"" Agarwal said.
The SP said the victim claimed that after raping her, the accused had inserted an iron rod in her private part but when the police tried to get her medically examined at a Meerut hospital, she refused.
""After preliminary treatment, when we tried to get her medical examination conducted, she refused. Doctors referred her to the Meerut Medical college for treatment but she refused to go there.
""The woman was then taken to a Delhi hospital and is undergoing treatment there. Police is taking legal advice to obtain evidence,"" said the SP.
Police said the FIR was filed based on the statement of the victim's brother.
According to the FIR, the woman told her brother that she was pushed inside a car forcefully at gunpoint while waiting at Ashram Chowk.
There were four people inside the car whom she knew. After taking her to an unknown place, five men raped her. When she was in an unconscious state, the men allegedly tied her hands and legs and wrapped her inside the jute bag. Thereafter, they took her inside the vehicle to another location where they dumped her, according to the FIR.
In a statement, Dr Rajat Jhamb, media spokesperson of the GTB Hopital said the woman was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday morning. Her vitals were stable, he said.
""No internal injury has been found till now. She is under observation and admitted in the gynaecology department,"" he said.
According to the DCW, the woman was allegedly gang-raped and tortured for two days. The notice has been issued to Ghaziabad Senior Superintendent of Police seeking an action taken report and a copy of the FIR along with details of arrests made.
Swati Maliwal said, ""The incident is very horrific and disturbing. It reminds me of the Nirbhaya case. All accused must be arrested immediately and strict action taken against them. I fail to understand how long women and children be subjected to such extreme brutality.""
Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi, who fought a long legal battle to get the accused punished, said though several years have passed, things have not changed on the ground.
""It can never be forgotten. We can never forget what our daughter went through because every day similar kind of incidents are happening across the country. It is saddening that in the last 10 years, things have not changed ... Several laws have been enacted to protect women but they have not translated into action on the ground,"" Asha Devi told PTI.
The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before being thrown out on the road.
She died on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.
""The perpetrators do not have any fear of law because they know that they will find support somewhere. Whenever they are being tried, some person or the other starts talking about their human rights.
""But what about the victim? Due to the trauma of recalling the incident at various stages of investigation and in court hearings, she loses the will power,"" she added.
Asha Devi also said some incidents are highlighted in the media and people talk about them but there are many such incidents happening across the country, which do not receive the spotlight.
Delhi's Former Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said it is ""shameful"" that the law and order situation is ""helpless"" before such ""beasts"".
""It is very shameful where our society is heading to. Why is our law and order situation helpless before such beasts. When will fear be developed among them. I will go to GTB hospital to meet her and extend her every possible help,"" Gautam tweeted in Hindi.

The school has been asked why the incident was allegedly not reported to police (File)
New Delhi:
An 11-year-old student was allegedly gang-raped by two seniors inside the washroom of a Kendriya Vidyalaya in the national capital following which a case has been registered, police officials said on Thursday.
The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan's regional office has also ordered an enquiry into the issue.
The alleged incident had taken place in July but the victim approached the police on Tuesday only after the matter was highlighted by the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW).
The DCW, which termed the incident as a ""serious matter"", issued a notice to Delhi Police and the school principal on the issue.
The school authorities have been asked to inform why the incident was allegedly not reported to the police by them.
Officials of the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) maintained that the incident was not reported to the school principal by the victim or her parents and has only come to light following police investigation.
KVS is an autonomous body under the Ministry of Education and it oversees over 1,200 KVs that are spread across 25 regions in the country.
According to the police, the victim filed a complaint on Tuesday and immediately a case was registered.
DCW Chairperson Swati Maliwal said, ""We have received a very serious case of gang-rape with an 11-year-old student inside a school in Delhi. The girl has alleged that her school teacher tried to hush up the matter. It is very unfortunate that even schools are unsafe for children in the capital.”
She demanded strict action in the matter.
“Also an enquiry into the role of school authorities must be conducted on the issue,"" Maliwal added.
According to the Commission, the minor alleged that in July while she was going to her classroom, she collided with two boys from her school studying in Class 11 and 12.
""She said that she apologised to the boys but they started abusing her and took her inside a toilet. She alleged that the boys locked the toilet door from inside and raped her. She stated that when she informed the incident to a teacher, she was told that the boys have been expelled and the matter was allegedly hushed up,"" a DCW statement said.
KVS officials said no complaint regarding the matter was received by the school authorities.
""The regional office of KVS is investigating the issue. The incident was not reported to the principal by the girl or her parents. The issue was also not raised at a parent-teacher meeting held after the incident,"" a senior KVS official said.
""The issue has come to our notice only through police investigation. We are cooperating with Delhi Police in its proceedings,"" the official added.
The police officials said that a detailed investigation is underway.
Based on the statement of the victim, the teaching staff and suspected students are being interrogated, police said.
The DCW sought from the police an action-taken report on the incident.
""The Commission has asked the school principal to inform as to when did the school authorities learn about the matter and what action was taken by them. It has also asked the school to furnish a copy of enquiry report conducted in the matter,” the panel said.

Prior to this, the high court, on August 17, had dismissed Shahnawaz Hussain's plea(FILE)
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court would hear on September 23 the plea of BJP leader Shahnawaz Hussain against a Delhi High Court order relating to the registration of an FIR against him on a woman's complaint alleging rape.
A bench comprising Chief Justice Uday Umesh Lalit and Justices Ajay Rastogi and S Ravindra Bhat Monday took note of the request of the counsel of the complainant woman and decided to hear the plea of Mr Hussain on Friday.
The court on August 22 stayed the operation of the High Court order relating to the registration of the FIR against Mr  Hussain on a woman's complaint alleging rape.
In a brief hearing, senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the BJP leader, said that a false allegation has been levelled.
The court adjourned the hearing after the counsel for the woman sought the adjournment.
Prior to this, the high court, on August 17, had dismissed Mr Hussain's plea challenging a trial court order directing the Delhi Police to register an FIR against him, saying there was no perversity in the 2018 order, and vacated its earlier interim order staying the operation.
The top court, while issuing notices to Delhi police and the complainant woman on the plea of the leader, had observed that after hearing submissions of Rohatgi, it was of the prima facie view that this matter required consideration.
The bench had then said that pending further consideration, the effect and operation of the order under challenge before it shall remain stayed.
In 2018, a Delhi-based woman approached a lower court seeking registration of an FIR against Mr Hussain on her allegation of rape.
Mr Hussain has denied the allegations.
A magisterial court had on July 7, 2018, ordered the registration of an FIR against Mr Hussain, saying a cognisable offence was made out in the complaint of the woman.
This was challenged by the BJP leader before a sessions court which had dismissed his plea.
In its order, the high court had said, ""There is no merit in the present petition. The petition is dismissed. The interim orders stand vacated. The FIR be registered forthwith. The investigations will be completed and a detailed report under Section 173 CrPC be submitted before the learned MM (metropolitan magistrate) within three months.""
The high court had also said that while reference is made in the police status report to the recording of the statement of the prosecutrix on four occasions, there was no explanation as to why the FIR was not lodged.
""The FIR only puts the machinery into operation. It is a foundation for the investigation of the offence complained of. It is only after investigations that the police can come to the conclusion whether or not an offence had been committed and if so by whom. In the present case, there seems to be a complete reluctance on the part of the police to even register an FIR,"" the high court had said.

The woman was kidnapped and raped in 2017 (Representational)
New Delhi:
The Unnao rape survivor has filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking the transfer of a criminal case filed against her in Unnao district, Uttar Pradesh, to Delhi.

Approaching the top court, she submitted that a non-bailable warrant (NBW) was issued against her by the Unnao ACJM court in an FIR filed by the father of Shubham Singh, one of three men currently facing trial in New Delhi for the gang rape of the survivor.
She has called the case filed by the father of Singh, alleging that a proof of age document provided by her to the police was forged, a ""counterblast FIR"".
She said that the case before the Unnao court is being pursued with the ""oblique motive to intimidate, silence and harass"" her and claimed that there is a grave threat to her life in Unnao.
""The criminal case in Unnao may be transferred to Delhi to prevent the judicial process from becoming an instrument of oppression and harassment. The transfer of the trial to Delhi will not prejudice the respondents whatsoever, and the same is in the interest of justice, equity and due process,"" stated the plea while seeking transfer of the case.
The plea stated that she has filed an application before the ACJM Unnao for cancellation or withdrawal of the NBWs, saying that she is willing to appear before the court through video conferencing.
The plea further submitted the counter-case is an abuse of the criminal justice process to drag her out of New Delhi and bring her to Unnao, where she will not only be at grave risk of harm and injury but also tormented by the memory of being repeatedly raped.
""There is a clear, grave and real risk to the personal safety and life of the petitioner, if she is forced to appear before and face a criminal trial in Unnao district, where she was repeatedly raped and gang-raped in 2017, by powerful people enjoying political and social clout, who also deviously murdered the petitioner's father with the connivance of police officers of PS Makhi,"" the plea submitted.
The woman was kidnapped and raped allegedly by former BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh in 2017 when she was a minor.
On August 1, 2019, the top court had transferred five cases pertaining to the rape and gang rape of the petitioner, as well as the murder and custodial death of her father, was transferred from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi. It had ordered the trial to be finished within 45 days.
The Supreme Court had also directed that the survivor, her mother, and other members of the family be provided security by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).
On December 20, 2019, Sengar was sentenced to jail for the ""remainder of his natural biological life"" in the rape case. Sengar was convicted under Section 376 IPC and sections 5(c) and 6 of the POCSO Act.
On March 4, 2020, Sengar, his brother, and five others were convicted for the death of the rape survivor's father in judicial custody and were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.

The Delhi Commission has asked the police to give a detailed report by August 14. (Representational)
New Delhi:
Three girls were allegedly kidnapped and raped after giving them beverages with sedatives in Delhi's Rohini, police said on Thursday.
Four people, including two women, have been arrested in connection with this case, they said.
The Delhi Commission of Women has sought from the police a detailed action taken report in the matter, latest by August 14.
On August 6, a resident of Masjid Moth had approached the Defence Colony police station alleging that his daughter had left for school in Andrews Ganj at around 7.30 am but did not return.
He said a school van used to ferry her.
At around 2 pm, the van driver informed the man that his daughter had not boarded his vehicle that morning. Police also found that she was absent from school.
Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Benita Mary Jaiker said the police found that not only the complainant's daughter but two other girls from the school, too, had gone missing.
""During investigation, parents and classmates of all missing girls were questioned. CCTV footage of the area was checked. Meanwhile, information was received about their movement in Karol Bagh area from where they were traced and medically examined. All the prosecutrix gave history of sexual assault,"" she said.
After their rescue from Karol Bagh, the girls said in their statements that one of the accused took them to a house in Rohini area where they were kept hostage and raped. However, they managed to flee from that house.
The DCP said a police team was sent to the house in Rohini from where it arrested Bangali Lal Sharma (45), Sandeep (36), Ruksana (40) and Jyoti (19).
Prakash, who allegedly raped the three girls, is missing, the officer said.
Sharma revealed to the police that he, along with Ruksana, used to run a syndicate of human trafficking. They wanted to sell the girls in Chandigarh, the DCP added.
They have been booked under sections 328 (Causing hurt by means of poison, etc., with intent to commit an offence), 366A (Procuration of minor girl), 370 (Buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 376 (rape), 506 ( criminal intimidation), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.
Ruksana and Jyoti have been sent to 14 days' judicial custody. Sharma and Sandeep are being interrogated, the DCP said .
The DCW said in a statement that the girls had planned to go to Mumbai together and reached New Delhi Railway Station on August 6. There, they met a stranger, who offered to book their tickets and took them to his room in Rohini.
Terming it a ""very serious"" matter, the DCW has sent a notice to the police seeking a copy of the FIR and other details, including details of the accused.

The accused was convicted of offences under the POCSO Act upon his own daughter. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A minor victim of sexual offence suffers grave psychological impact by being present during court proceedings and it is in her interest that she is not traumatised again by having to relive the incident, Delhi High Court has said.
Justice Jasmeet Singh noted that arguments in court proceedings include assertions doubting the victim's integrity and character while she is forced to be present in the same space as the person who has allegedly violated her.
The judge, who was hearing an appeal by a man convicted of perpetrating offences under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) upon his own daughter, sought the stand of the Delhi State as well as the high court's legal services authority on certain practice directions to govern the presence of victims in courts in bail hearings.
The allegations against the appellant included commission of offences under section 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and sections 376 (rape)/506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) IPC.
""The psychological impact on a POCSO victim being present in Court is immensely grave as the arguments vary from allegations, accusations, doubting integrity, character etc.
The prosecutrix/victim is forced to be present in the Court with the accused that is the same person who allegedly has violated her,"" said the court in its order dated August 1.
""It is in the interest of the victim that she is not traumatised again by re-living the said incident/court proceedings which could be triggering for her. In this view of the matter, the suggested practice directions be sent to the Member Secretary, DHCLSC (Delhi High Court Legal Services Committee) and DSLSA (Delhi State Legal Services Authority) for their inputs,"" it added.
The court also took on record the suggestions made by the counsel for the appellant on this issue. The appellant in the case has sought suspension of the sentence of 10-year rigorous imprisonment and fine during the pendency of his appeal.
The court noted that while there were chances of the appellant visiting Rajasthan, where his wife and the victim were residing, he might undergo the whole sentence without the appeal being heard if relief was not granted to him.
Observing that only a period of 1 year and about 9 months were left for him to serve, the court said that the sentence needed to be suspended as the appellant has undergone its substantial portion and there was no reasonable chance that the appeal would be taken up for hearing in the near future.
The court directed the release of the appellant on a personal bond with one local surety in the sum of Rs 20,000 and on the condition that he ""shall not visit the State of Rajasthan under any circumstances whatsoever"".
The court also directed the appellant not to connect with or be in touch with his wife or the victim and appear before it when his appeal is taken up for hearing.

""This is very sad that crimes against women have surged in the capital. The crimes by husband have also increased. We need to look what is the reason behind this? Are our men feeling insecure and why are they resorting to this? ""The surge may also be due to an increase in reporting of crime. Maybe, many and many women are coming forward to report such incidents. It is good they are speaking up and not hiding,"" said Chhavi Methi, an activist with the Bhartiya Samajik Jagritik Sanghatan.

The woman was taken to AIIMS Trauma Center and thoroughly examined, the police officials said.
New Delhi:
A 23-year-old woman who levelled rape allegations against the son of Rajasthan minister was attacked with ink on a road in Delhi on Saturday, police officials told NDTV. A case has been filed and an investigation has been ordered into the matter, they said.
The attack took place while she was walking on the road with her mother in in southeast Delhi. Two men were involved in the attack, the woman said in her complaint to the police.
The men threw a ""blue liquid"" at her near Kalindi Kunj Road and fled.
The woman was taken to AIIMS Trauma Center and thoroughly examined, the police officials said.
""The blue liquid prima facie looks like ink. In the matter, a case under section 195 A (threatening any person to give false evidence), 506 (criminal intimidation), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code was registered at the Shaheen Bagh police station and an investigation is underway,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) Esha Pandey said.
The DCP said police are looking for CCTV footage from the area to identify the culprits and ascertain the sequence of events.
The woman is the complainant in a rape case filed against the son of Rajasthan Minister Mahesh Joshi. Following her complaint, a case was registered in Delhi and a police team was sent to Jaipur to arrest the minister's son, Rohit Joshi, last month. The minister's son was however not found at home.
Rohit Joshi appeared before the Delhi Police team yesterday. He appeared after securing anticipatory bail from a court in Delhi.
Taking to Twitter on Sunday, Delhi Commission for Women chairperson Swati Maliwal said she would be issuing a notice to the Delhi Police to file an FIR for the attack on the woman and accused Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot of saving his minister's son.
""The girl who accused Rohit Joshi, son of Rajasthan Minister Mahesh Joshi of rape was thrown some substance by two unidentified people in Delhi.....@ashokgehlot51 sir, instead of saving your minister's son, arrest him. I am issuing notice to Delhi Police for FIR on this attack (sic),"" she tweeted.
In her complaint, the woman has alleged that the minister's son raped her on several occasions between January 8 last year and April 17 this year, and also promised to marry her.
The woman said she developed a friendship with Rohit Joshi on Facebook last year and they have been in contact since then. She also accused Rohit Joshi of kidnapping and blackmailing.
Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has ruled out the possibility of any action against minister Mahesh Joshi, the father of the accused, contending that there is no allegation or charge against the minister.

The court's verdict came on PILs filed in 2015 and 2017 by NGOs
New Delhi:
An appeal has been filed in the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court's split verdict on the issue of criminalisation of marital rape on a batch of petitions challenging the exception in the law that exempts husbands from being prosecuted for non-consensual sexual intercourse with their wives.
The appeal has been filed by Khushboo Saifi, one of the petitioners before the high court.
The high court on May 11 had delivered a split verdict on the issue.
However, both the judges, Justice Rajiv Shakdher and Justice C Hari Shankar on the bench concurred with each other for granting a certificate of leave to appeal to the Supreme Court in the matter as it involves substantial questions of law which requires a decision from the top court. While Justice Shakdher, who headed the division bench, favoured striking down the marital rape exception for being ""unconstitutional"" and said it would be ""tragic if a married woman's call for justice is not heard even after 162 years"" since the enactment of the IPC, Justice Shankar said the exception under the rape law is not ""unconstitutional and was based on an intelligible differentia"".
The petitioners had challenged the constitutionality of the marital rape exception under Section 375 IPC (rape) on grounds that it discriminated against married women who are sexually assaulted by their husbands. Under the exception given in Section 375 of the IPC, sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his wife, the wife not being minor, is not rape.
The bench delivered a 393-page split verdict in the matter. Justice Shakdher, in the 192 pages penned by him, regretted that he was not able to persuade Justice Shankar to his point of view and said he, perhaps, hears a beat of a different drummer. I respect that. Justice Shankar, who gave dissenting views in 200 pages written by him, said the challenge to the vires of the second exception to Section 375 and Section 376B of the IPC and Section 198B of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as raised in these petitions, must fail.
He said it remained a matter of lasting regret that their differences, regarding the outcome of these proceedings, appear irreconcilable.
Justice Shakdher also said, ""to the petitioners and their ilk I would say it may seem that you plough a lonely furrow today but it will change, if not now, someday. To the naysayers, I would say that every dissent adds flavour and acuteness to the debate at hand, which assists the next court, if nothing else, in arriving at a conclusion which is closer to justice and truth .
The court's verdict came on PILs filed in 2015 and 2017 by NGOs RIT Foundation, All India Democratic Women's Association, a man and a woman seeking striking down of the exception granted to husbands under the Indian rape law.

The victim also accused Rohit Joshi of blackmailing and kidnapping. (File)
Jaipur:
A Delhi Police team of 15 officials reached Jaipur this morning to arrest Rajasthan Minister Mahesh Joshi's son Rohit, who is accused of raping a 23-year-old woman. 
The police team visited two residences of the minister in the city. His son, however, was not found. ""Our teams are conducting a search to locate Rohit Joshi, who has been on the run,"" said a senior police officer.
The Delhi Police then summoned Rohit Joshi to appear before them by May 18. The officials pasted a copy of the summon on the wall of their residence.
In her complaint, the woman alleged that the minister's son raped her on several occasions between January 8 last year and April 17 this year, and also promised to marry her, following which the Delhi Police had registered a zero First Information Report or zero FIR initially.
Later, the zero FIR was converted into a regular FIR since the allegations of commission of sexual assault committed in Sadar Bazar police station jurisdiction were also mentioned in the complaint.
The woman said she developed a friendship with Rohit Joshi on Facebook last year and they have been in contact since then. She also accused Rohit Joshi of kidnapping and blackmailing.
""During their first meeting, she alleged, he spiked her drink and when she woke up the next morning, he showed her naked photographs and videos which worried her,"" reads the FIR.
The woman further stated that on August 11, 2021, she found out that she was pregnant with his baby and alleged that Rohit Joshi forced her to take an abortion pill but she didn't.
Reacting to the allegations against his son, Mr Joshi said, ""I have already said this before that I stand by the truth and justice. I am a law-abiding citizen. When the Delhi police will come to me, I will support their investigation.""
Meanwhile, the Opposition BJP in Rajasthan alleged that the state government is trying to save the accused. ""It is unfortunate that the government is trying to save the accused. It is the Congress culture, which tries to cover up such cases eventually, which is unfortunate,"" Leader of Opposition in the state Assembly Gulab Chand Kataria said last week.
Mahesh Joshi is considered to be a close aide of Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot.

Court Refuses To Interfere In Case Against Indian Origin Rape Accused

The judge said there isn't any substantial proof to suggest any discrimination.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has refused to interfere with the proceedings initiated for the extradition of a Portuguese national of Indian origin for a rape case against him in London, saying that mere unsubstantiated apprehension of discrimination on account of his race cannot be held to be a sufficient reason to mistrust the state functionaries of the United Kingdom.
Justice Chandra Dhari Singh stated that the petitioner, who invoked Article 9 of the applicable treaty which provides relief if the prosecution is on account of the person's race, religion, nationality, or political opinions, has not provided any substantial proof to suggest any discrimination.
There is no justiciable proof of the petitioner being arraigned due to racial discrimination or the case being racially motivated, the judge said.
The court dismissed the petitioner's plea seeking to make full disclosure of the evidence collected during the investigation and opined that the petitioner has been escaping arrest on frivolous grounds and the present petition is one such attempt.
“A mere unsubstantiated apprehension of discrimination or bias cannot be held to be a sufficient reason to mistrust the state functionaries of the United Kingdom, hence, a case for claiming relief under Article 9 of the Treaty is not made out. Accordingly, there appears no reason to intervene with proceedings and pass any such order for disclosure of additional information or evidence,” the court said in its order dated May 11.
“Accordingly, in order for Article 9 to be deemed applicable, the petitioner must reasonably “satisfy” the Court that the request for his extradition has been made for the purpose of prosecuting him on account of his race. However, the petitioner has not provided any substantial proof on record to suggest any discrimination that might be applicable against him in the United Kingdom,” it added.
The judge further said that the requisite evidence for extradition proceedings against the petitioner has already been supplied and only a prima facie case is to be seen by the trial court in the course of extradition proceedings.
“The petitioner will get adequate opportunity to represent himself, ask for disclosure of evidence, as well as cross-examine the same at the stage of the trial. Thus, it is clear that no violation of the duty to adequate disclosure can be said to have occurred in the present case,” the court stated.
The petitioner, who allegedly committed rape of a lady at a pub in London in May 2017 and came back to India in June of the same year, has been charged with the offence of rape under Section 1(1) of the Sexual Offences Act, 2003 of UK and arrest warrant was issued.
In September 2020, the central government ordered a magisterial inquiry under the Extradition Act upon receipt of a request from the UK and in March 2021, extradition proceedings were initiated against the petitioner in the court of an additional chief metropolitan.
The petitioner argued before the high court that the evidence produced or information supplied in the present case is not sufficient to decide the extradition request and that the case against him is false and racially motivated.
The petitioner, in his plea before the court, claimed that he did not receive humongous amounts of documentary evidence, medical evidence, forensic evidence, CCTV footage, audio recordings of the interviews taken by the UK Police, details of calls made to the UK Police, formal police complaint, and record of seizure of articles, etc.
The central government argued that the petitioner is a fugitive criminal and the present case is extraditable in terms of the Extradition Treaty.PTI ADS RKS RKS

Delhi Rape Convicts' 20 Years Jail Term Inadequate, Increase It: Cops To Court
In the gruesome incident at Gandhi Nagar in East Delhi on April 15, 2013, the two convicts had raped and shoved objects in the girl's private parts

The trial court had in January 2020 sentenced the men to 20 years in jail. (Representational)
New Delhi:
The Delhi Police Monday urged the Delhi High Court to enhance the punishment of 20 years imprisonment awarded to two men for raping a five-year-old girl and shoving objects in her body here in 2013.
A bench of Justices Siddharth Mridul and Rajnish Bhatnagar said it would hear the plea on August 22.
In the gruesome incident at Gandhi Nagar in East Delhi on April 15, 2013, the two convicts had raped and shoved objects in the minor survivor's private parts and abandoned her in a room, believing she was dead. The child was rescued 40 hours later on April 17, 2013.
The trial court had in January 2020, convicted and sentenced Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar to 20 years in jail in the case.
Shah has also approached the high court challenging his conviction and sentence.
Prosecutor Ashish Dutta, representing the State, submitted that the trial court awarded just 20 years of imprisonment to the two men which was not adequate considering the nature of the offence, and urged the high court to enhance the sentence.
The trial court had on January 18, 2020, convicted Shah and Kumar under sections 363 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful confinement), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 376 (2) (gang rape), 377 (unnatural offence) and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
Shah and Kumar were arrested from Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga in Bihar on April 20 and April 22 in 2013, respectively.
The police had said some foreign materials — three pieces of a candle and one hair oil bottle — were taken out from the body of the survivor, which was also proved by doctors during the recording of their statements in the court.
The girl had undergone multiple surgeries at the AIIMS in Delhi.
The incident had taken place four months after another gruesome gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedic student, who came to be known as Nirbhaya, on December 16, 2012.
While sentencing the two convicts, the trial court had said the minor girl experienced “exceptional depravity and extreme brutality” and awarded her a compensation of Rs 11 lakh.
In an over 100-page judgment, the court had said: “In our society, minor girls are worshipped as a goddess on certain occasions, but in the present case, the child, who was aged about five years at the time of the incident, had experienced exceptional depravity and extreme brutality.” “The crime against her was committed in a most grotesque and revolting manner and the collective conscience of the community was shaken,” the court had said.
In 2014, Kumar moved the court claiming he was a juvenile at the time of his arrest.
The trial court took three years to decide his application for juvenility and transferred the case in April 2017 to the Juvenile Justice Board, which granted him bail.
Following this, the mother of the rape survivor moved the Delhi High Court against the trial court's order declaring Kumar to be a juvenile. The high court in 2018 declared that he was not a juvenile and sent him to trial before the sessions court.

The accused called the girl, raped and killed her, the police said. (Representational image)
New Delhi:
A 32-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly raping and killing a 14-year-old girl in north Delhi's Narela area, police said.
The accused has been identified as Sunil, a resident of Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district, they said.
The police said a case of kidnapping had been registered on February 15 after receiving a complaint from the girl's father, a resident of a village in Narela.
On February 19, a man named Rahul Rai, who runs a business of making covers of nail polish bottles in the same village, told the police that after coming back from Jhansi, when he opened his shop, foul smell was coming from inside it.
A labourer named Sunil who used to work with him was also missing, Rai told the police.
The police searched the shop where the partially decomposed body of the girl was found under a heap of cow dung cakes kept in gunny bags, the officer said.
During investigation, a man named Ram Sacche alias Sachin was arrested from the outskirts of the village on February 20 while trying to escape to Mumbai, police said.
Interrogation revealed that he along with Sunil consumed alcohol on February 12 at Metro Vihar and planned to call the teenage girl, police said.
The accused called the girl, raped her and then strangulated her to death, police said.
The police later got a tip-off that Sunil would come to meet someone and accordingly laid a trap, Deputy Commissioner of Police (outer north) Brijendra Kumar Yadav said.
On Tuesday, after spotting the accused, the police asked him to stop but he kept running. The police asked him to surrender but the accused took out a pistol and fired at the police, the DCP said.
The police also fired and one bullet hit on his leg, following which he was arrested, Mr Yadav said.
The accused has confessed that he along Sacche had raped and murdered the girl and dumped the body in the shop, police said.

The woman, 20, was allegedly kidnapped, gang-raped, and paraded by the accused
New Delhi:
Delhi police on Monday filed a charge sheet before a court here against 21 persons in connection with an incident in which a 20-year-old woman was allegedly kidnapped, gang-raped, and paraded by a group of people in east Delhi's Kasturba Nagar in February.
The charge sheet consisting of a total of 762 pages named 12 women, four men, and five minors as accused was filed in a court.
The charge sheet was filed under various sections of the IPC, including criminal conspiracy, gang rape, attempt to murder, dacoity, and kidnapping.
Police said that Darshan Singh, the owner of the three-wheeler which was used to kidnap the woman, has also been named in the final report.
Delhi police have arrayed 48 persons as public and police witnesses including doctors in the charge sheet.
In the report, police said that a total of 26 videos, 12 from social media and 14 from mobile of the accused persons, were recovered.
According to police, the crime was committed with the intention to take revenge for the death of a person and the intention was allegedly to kill the woman.
During its probe, police collected scientific evidence with the assistance of the cyber team and FSL, and the psychological assessment of some of the accused was also carried out.
“The photographs of the accused persons have been taken by FSL experts in order to establish their identity. Assistance from cyber experts has also been taken for the source of viral videos. Psychiatrists have already examined the accused persons. Further, voice sample of the accused persons is also being taken,” the charge sheet said.
The survivor, 20, was allegedly kidnapped, gang-raped, and paraded by the accused on the streets of Kasturba Nagar with her hair chopped, face blackened and a shoe garland around her neck on January 26 this year.
Police had said the preliminary investigation indicated that the woman and a boy belonging to the family of the accused were friends.
“The boy committed suicide in November last year and his family blamed the victim (woman) for it. The family alleged that it was because of her that the boy took the extreme step. To exact revenge on her, the family members allegedly kidnapped her. They wanted to teach her a lesson,” a senior police official had said.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Tuesday announced a financial aid of Rs 10 lakh for the woman and said the government would appoint a lawyer to represent her in a fast-track court.
Police have stepped up security outside the house of the victim's sister in Kasturba Nagar after she filed a complaint alleging that she too was harassed, molested, and thrashed by the same assailants on January 19.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court today reserved its decision on the death penalty for three convicted for the rape and murder of a 19-year-old girl in Delhi's Chhawla. The atmosphere in the court turned emotional when the victim's father stood up with folded hands to present his case.
A bench of Justice Uday Umesh Lalit, Justice S Ravindra Bhat and Justice Bela M Trivedi was hearing the matter.
The three convicts were awarded the death penalty after being held guilty of raping and killing a 19-year-old woman in 2012. The victim's body mutilated body was found in a field with multiple injuries due to assault with objects ranging from car tools to earthen pots.
A Delhi court in February 2014 had convicted the three men and awarded them the death penalty. The capital punishment was confirmed by the Delhi High Court on August 26 2014, saying they were ""predators"" moving on the streets and ""were looking for prey"".
The Supreme Court will decide whether to uphold the death sentence of all three convicts.
Today, the lawyers of the convicts presented their side and pleaded to the court against the death sentence and sought the quantum of punishment to be reduced. They cited the age, family background and past history of the convicts as the basis of the arguments.
Then Additional Solicitor General Aishwarya Bhati argued against the appeal, on behalf of Delhi Police. She said that this crime has happened not only with the victim but with the whole society and no concession can be given to the guilty because they have committed such a heinous crime. She said, ""Due to crimes like these the parents do not allow their daughters to stay outside the house at dusk. The culprits not only gang-raped the girl but also insulted her dead body.""
After hearing both the sides, the lawyer of the victim's family urged the bench to hear the arguments of the family as well and said that the victim's father is present in Court.
The father of the victim stood up with folded hands. On seeing this, Justice Lalit, who was heading the bench, said that being a court of law, judgment is given on the basis of facts of the case and not on sentiments. He added that since the arguments of the victims are based on sentiments, considering their point of view may deviate from the direction of the case. Therefore, he cannot be allowed to represent the case.
But Justice Lalit added that he understands the pain and sorrow that the victim's family is going through, but the court has to decide on the basis of facts.

Delhi/Jodhpur: The survivor was then just five years old, police said. (Representational)
Jodhpur:
Police on Friday arrested a 23-year-old choreographer from Delhi for allegedly raping a student inside her school's toilet in Jodhpur four years ago.
The suspect, identified as Sanam Gill who is a native of Nepal, had settled in Delhi where he was working as choreographer and gym trainer, police said, adding that his family is living in Jodhpur. 
According to police, the incident took place in February 2018 when Gill had been engaged to train the children for a cultural performance for the annual function of the school. The survivor was then just five years old, police said.
Police said the incident came to the notice of the survivor's mother three days ago when she was teaching her about good touch and bad touch at home. It was then that the girl told her mother about the ordeal she suffered four years ago at her school.
The shocked mother took the daughter to a doctor, where she was subjected to a sonography test, report of which confirmed rape, police said, adding that the mother then filed a complaint against the choreographer.
Assistant commissioner of police Nishant Bhardwaj, who is investigating the case, said that the suspect had settled in Delhi about a month ago after his work had been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Describing the incident, ACP Bhardwaj said, ""On February 26, 2018, during a training session, he followed the victim to the toilet and raped her there. He threatened her not to tell about the incident to anyone.''
The scared victim did not tell anyone about the incident until a few days ago when her mother sat to educate her about good touch and bad touch, the ACP said.
ACP Bhardwaj said that after the complaint by the girl's mother, police began the investigation and traced the suspect to Delhi from where he was arrested.

""Acting upon this information, the shop was searched, where a partially decomposed body of that missing girl was found in one corner of the shop, under the heap of cow dung cakes (thepla) kept in the gunny bags,"" the DCP said.

The petition stated that the petitioner has been vexatiously roped into a false case in the UK,
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has sought the status report from the Central government on a plea moved by an absconding accused wanted in an alleged rape case in the United Kingdom.
The petitioner has sought a direction for a full disclosure of evidence, collected during the investigation for the alleged rape case at a London pub registered against him in London, UK in May 2017.
Justice Chandra Dhari Singh on Monday issued directions to the Ministry of External Affairs to file a status report on the petition moved by Jose Inacio Cota, a person of Indian origin and a Portuguese citizen. The court has listed the petition for hearing on 11 March 2022.
The counsel for the Central government objected to the petition on the ground that the petitioner is not appearing in extradition proceedings before the lower court. The petitioner is wanted in a rape case in the UK and his extradition request has been filed by the UK authorities to face trial in the matter.
Advocate Arpit Batra, counsel for the petitioner, argued that there is a treaty between India and the UK. The UK is bound to provide all the documents and evidence collected during the investigation against a person of Indian origin.
The petitioner who is originally a resident of Goa has moved a petition through advocate Arpit Batra. The petition has sought a direction for full disclosure of the evidence collected during the investigation in London in physical and electronic form.
The petition stated that such evidence may include medical evidence, forensic evidence, CCTV footage, the audio recording of the interviews taken by the UK police, details of calls made to the UK Police, formal police complaint and record of seizure of articles.
The counsel for the petitioner submitted that this will assist the petitioner in exercising his fundamental rights, as well as in building a defence for him.
The petition stated that the petitioner has been vexatiously roped into a false case in the UK, which is racially motivated and thus discriminatory and prejudicial toward the petitioner.
The petitioner further stated the extradition proceedings have infringed the fundamental right guaranteed to the petitioner under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India and certain basic rights guaranteed under various Conventions, Bilateral Treaties and Multinational Agreements.
The petition stated that the alleged case was registered on May 28, 2017. The petitioner had flown from London to Mumbai on June 5, 2017. His arrest warrant was issued on June 11, 2019 by the UK Court. An extradition request was sent by the UK Government to the Ministry of External Affairs of India on September 18, 2020. A Complaint case was filed in Patiala House Court of New Delhi by the Central Government on March 26, 2021. An NBW was issued against the petitioner through the CBI Interpol on July 3, 2021.

A Delhi court has acquitted a Lt. Commander serving in Indian Navy in a rape case. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has acquitted a Lt. Commander serving in Indian Navy in a rape case and noted that at three different stages, three different versions were given by the prosecutrix.
Additional Sessions Judge Ankur Jain, Tis Hazari court, in a judgement passed last week said, the benefit of the doubt has to go to the accused and he is acquitted for the offence charged with.
The defence counsel Ravi Drall for the accused argued that the relationship between the complainant and the accused were consensual in nature and no alleged crime was committed by his client. Ravi Drall further argued that the version of the prosecutrix keeps changing and improving her version at different stages which ultimately makes her statements unreliable.
Court also noted several discrepancies and said it appears that the present complaint was made to pressurize the accused to enter into a matrimonial alliance, succumbing to the pressure at the time of hearing of the bail application, accused had married the prosecutrix which is reflected from the bail order and the photographs so placed on record. The alliance did not survive and ultimately both of them took divorce, the court added.
Court also noted that it is also quite unnatural that the victim did not tell anything to her mother just after the incident or even thereafter and waited for about two days till the time marriage was called off by the mother of the accused.
Court further noted that the prosecutrix has given three different versions regarding the presence of her brother. In her initial complaint brother was not in the picture, despite the fact that there was a delay of about three days in making the complaint.
According to complainant, she got engaged to the accused in 2015 with the permission of family members and they used to talk on mobile phone regularly. As per the complainant, the accused and his family members were invited toa religious function at her uncles' house where she was raped later on by the accused and thereafter the FIR was lodged at Janakpuri police station under section 376 IPC.

Opinion: The Filmed Assault And Lynching Of A Young Mother In Delhi

The barbaric violence perpetrated against a 20-year-old working woman, a mother of a two-year-old child, has led to widespread outrage after a video went viral of the torture the young woman faced in Delhi. In the FIR published in the media, it is stated that she was abducted from her home, her child snatched away, and then she was forcibly taken to another area, sexually assaulted in crimes amounting to gangrape, brutally beaten, tonsured; her face was blackened, she was garlanded with shoes, abused, heckled, paraded around the lanes of her neighbourhood.
The video shows some part of what she faced. We see her surrounded by men, women and children who clap and jeer every time she is pushed and her head pulled and slapped, even as she screams in pain and begs for mercy. Another video shows her being kicked to the floor by a young man and being brutally whipped with a belt. It is horrific. All this happened in broad daylight. It went on for over an hour. The area where this happened is not in a remote village but in a busy area in the eastern part of the capital of India.
It is now known that her attack was in apparently retaliation by a family whose young male member committed suicide in November last year. The family blamed the young woman for his death. Since then, they have been harassing the girl and her family. She had to leave her job because they went to the shop where she worked and created a scene. She had to shift house along with her husband and child because of the threats of violence she received. Her younger sister, too, was threatened. She made several complaints to the Delhi Police but no one acted on them.
After the video, the Chairperson of the Delhi Commission of Women called the criminal attackers ""animals""; she said they are involved in the illicit liquor business and are ""known criminals"". She gave an ultimatum to the police to take action. The former Chairperson of the National Commission of Women called them ""monsters"". The BJP Member of Parliament, Gautam Gambhi, who visited the family, referred to the criminals as ""beasts"" and ""animals"" and assured the citizens of Delhi that justice would be done. Four days after the incident, nine persons, including seven women, have been arrested. And does the matter end there, now that the ""animals and monsters"" have been locked up?
The questions that arise are familiar to those fighting for justice and for prevention of crimes against women. Why did the Delhi Police not act on the complaint of the younger sister, made a week before the attack? If the police had acted in time, the young woman could have been saved. How could such a crime occur in a public space, with scores of people watching a young woman being lynched, and the police totally absent? The victim stated that after she was paraded publicly, she was again taken into a room and brutalized. If the police had come in time, at least she could have been saved from some part of the violence. The role of the police in this case, as in so many others, has been outrageous. Yet there is no inquiry into police connivance or even dereliction of duty. The other shocking and cruel reality is that but for the video being made public, the perpetrators of the violence could have got away with it. Yet in this case, as has been proved in so many others, the video itself was possibly shot by those who perpetrated the violence, an extension of their power over the victim.
But are all those who stood by as spectators not liable? At the time of the anti-Sati legislation in 1987, there was a debate among activists about the responsibility of spectators who allowed a murder in the name of Sati to take place. It was agreed that there must be a legal obligation on citizens to prevent such a crime if they have knowledge that it was going to happen. A clause was included that not only officers but ""inhabitants of such area shall, if they have reason to believe or have the knowledge that Sati is about to be, or has been, committed in the area shall forthwith report such fact to the nearest police station"" and if they do not, they could face a fine or imprisonment upto two years. Later, during the struggle for a legislation against crimes committed in the name of ""Honour"", the draft prepared by the then National Commission of Women along with women activists specifically mentioned the penalty for those not reporting an ""Honour Crime"" of which they had knowledge. That draft legislation is still pending. The point is the responsibility of citizens is essential, particularly in cases of prevention of crimes against women. In the Shahdara case, it was the younger sister of the victim who kept calling the police and saved her sister.
But the case also highlights another truth which it would be utterly hypocritical to ignore. Are those who promote public lynching, who organise public lynchings, who humiliate, beat, kill in the name of prevention of cow slaughter, or of 'love jihad', or against growing a beard and wearing a white skull cap, not monsters and beasts? How would Gautam Gambhir describe political leaders who extend patronage and protection and promote such criminal activities as mob lynching? When we express our anguish, anger and horror at the Shahdara crime, as indeed we must do, we cannot forget that it is also a result of the normalization of such crimes by the horrific and the blood-soaked culture of mob lynching promoted by those in positions of power. 
The incident of public lynching in the capital of India, by some terrible coincidence, occurred on Republic Day. Could it be a symbol of the political and social distance travelled from the promotion of values that create responsible citizens to their opposite?

Lucknow:
Seema Kushwaha, a Supreme Court lawyer and who fought for the victim in the '2012 Nirbhaya gangrape case in Delhi, joined Bahujan Samaj Party on Thursday.
Ms Kushwaha joined the BSP in the presence of the party's national general secretary Satish Chandra Misra here today.
Earlier today, she had said that she is joining the party to ensure justice to the weaker section of the society.
Ms Kushwaha also fought for justice in the rape case in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras.
She is also the founder of Nirbhaya Jyoti Trust and has launched a campaign to ensure justice for the victims of rape.
The Nirbhaya rape case had shaken the country in 2012 when a 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was brutally gang-raped and assaulted by six men in a moving bus in Delhi in December 2012 and was thrown out on the road. She succumbed to her injuries at a Singapore hospital on December 29, 2012. It took seven years to deliver justice to the victim. The four convicts in the Nirbhaya case were hanged to death at 5:30 a.m. in Delhi's Tihar jail on March 20, 2020, after a three-judge Supreme Court bench rejected the final plea by the convicts' lawyer.
Meanwhile, Bahujan Samaj Party on Wednesday released the names of the candidates for the first phase of Assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh.
The party had released the first list of candidates on 53 assembly seats of Uttar Pradesh for the upcoming polls last week.
Polling in Uttar Pradesh will be held on February 10, 14, 20, 23, 27, and March 3 and 7 in seven phases. The counting of votes will take place on March 10.

Faridabad: The accused was previously convicted of killing his uncle and cousin. (Representational)
Faridabad:
The arrest of a man in Faridabad in connection with a rape and murder case opened a can of worms as the accused confessed to raping and killing three other girls in two years.
The accused, Singhraj Nagar (54), security guard at a private hospital in Sector 16 in Faridabad and a native of Jasana village, was previously convicted of killing his uncle and cousin, some 36 years ago.
Explaining his modus operandi, police on Monday said Nagar used to rape girls or young women, strangle them to death and dump their bodies in the Agra canal. The bodies would flow away, leaving no evidence for the police.
However, in the fourth case, the body stuck in the bushes, an officer said.
In the first week of January, two days after allegedly killing a 21-year-old woman and dumping her body in the canal, Nagar learnt that the body had stuck in the bushes and did not float away, unlike the other three bodies.
He then called up the woman's grandmother in his village and confessed to killing her.
The woman's grandmother informed the police about Nagar, who in turn, arrested him. During investigation, Nagar revealed to the police that he had raped and killed three minor girls since 2019.
“Nagar was acquainted with the fourth victim, a BA final year student, since a couple of years. On December 31, he took her to his village Jasana, about 16 km away from Faridabad, on his bicycle. He kept her in a room for for two days and raped her. Finally, he strangulated her to death and threw her body in the Agra canal,"" Narender Kadiyan, DCP (Crime), Faridabad, said.
In December 2019, Nagar had lured a 15-year-old daughter of a tea seller and allegedly raped her in his room at the hospital. He strangulated her when she tried to raise alarm and later dumped the body in the canal. In August 2020, he raped and killed a minor girl, sister of a housekeeping staff at the hospital and dumped her body in the canal.
In June 2021, he repeated his acts with another minor, the DCP said.
According to the officer, the police have recovered only the 21-year-old woman's body so far.
“Our team is questioning him and we hope some other cases will be solved too,” the DCP said.
In 1986, Nagar had killed his uncle and cousin, and was convicted in the case, the officer said.

A Delhi court has discharged Kuldeep Senger in the 2019 accident case of Unnao rape survivor
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has discharged former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Senger and five others in the 2019 accident case of Unnao rape survivor, saying that prima facie no charges are made out against him.
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey discharged the accused observing that prima facie there is no evidence against the accused persons - Senger, Komal Singh, Arun Singh, Gyanendra Singh, Rinku Singh and , Awdesh Singh.
The court however ordered framing of charges against four other accused - Ashish Kumar Pal, Vinod Mishra, Haripal Singh and Naveen Singh - as there was prima facie sufficient evidence against them.
In its order passed on Monday, the court noted that the charge sheet did not find mention of any record or evidence regarding the criminal conspiracy between the accused persons ordered to be put on trial with the accused Kuldeep Sengar.
""Accused Ashish Kumar Pal is directed to be charged for offence punishable under section 304-A (causing death by negligence), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), 279 (rash driving on a public way) of IPC and accused Vinod Mishra, Haripal Singh and Naveen Singh are directed to be separately charged for offence punishable under section 506(ii) (threat to cause death) of IPC, read with Section 34 (common intention) of IPC,"" the court said.
According to the prosecution, a truck rammed into the vehicle in which the Unnao rape victim was travelling to Rae Bareli with her two aunts and lawyer in July 2019.
While her aunts succumbed to their injuries, the rape survivor and her lawyer were grievously injured.
The order also noted that Kuldeep Sengar was in judicial custody during the period when the alleged threat was extended to the victim or her family members.
Admittedly the case of prosecution was that he conspired with the other accused to extend the threat to the victim or her family members and he himself not extended any threat, the court said.
On August 1, 2019 the Supreme Court transferred the case to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh.
On December 20, 2019, Kuldeep Sengar was sentenced to jail for the ""remainder of his natural biological life"" in a separate case for raping the minor in 2017.
On March 4, 2020, Kuldeep Sengar, his brother, and five others were also convicted for the death of the rape survivor's father in judicial custody and were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Monday discharged Kuldeep Singh Senger in the 2019 accident case of the Unnao rape victim saying that no charges were made out against him in the case.
Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey discharged Kuldeep Singh Senger and five other accused observing that prima facie there is no evidence against the accused - Senger, Komal Singh, Arun Singh, Gyanendra Singh, Rinku Singh, and Awdesh Singh.
However, the Court ordered framing of charges against four accused Ashish Kumar Pal, Vinod Mishra, Haripal Singh, and Naveen Singh. The court said that there is sufficient evidence against these accused persons.
In 2019, when the Unnao rape survivor was on her way to Rae Bareli with her two aunts and her lawyer, a truck rammed into their vehicle. While her aunts died, she and her lawyer were grievously injured.
As per the charge sheet, on July 28, 2019, between 12:45 pm and 12:50 pm, accused Ashish Kumar Pal was driving the truck on the wrong side of the road from Rai Bareilly towards Lalganj in a rash and negligent manner. The car being driven by advocate Mahender Singh collided with the back of the truck resulting in the death of the girl's two aunts besides grievously injuring him who later died as did the girl.
The court noted that the charge sheet did not mention any record or evidence regarding the criminal conspiracy between the accused persons with Kuldeep Singh Sengar.
The Court also noted that Kuldeep Singh Sengar was in judicial custody during the period when the alleged threats were extended to the girl or her family members. The Court also noted that admittedly the case of the prosecution is that he conspired with the other accused to threaten the victim or her family members but he himself did not threaten them.
Kuldeep Singh Senger was represented by advocates SPM Tripathi and Deepak Sharma.
On August 1, 2019, the Supreme Court transferred the case to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh. In December 2019, Senger was convicted and jailed for life for raping the woman in Unnao in 2017 when she was a minor.

The court called it a ""classic case of abuse of power by police"". (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has directed the Police Commissioner to take legal action and register a case against police officers for allegedly committing fraud by filing two distinct sets of charge sheets in a rape case, calling it a ""classic case of abuse of power by the police"".
Additional Sessions Judge Gaurav Rao came down heavily on the police after noting that the charge sheet that has been filed in the court and supplied to the counsel of the accused is different from the one with the prosecutor and the complainant's counsel.
""Both the charge sheets bear the signatures of the IO/SHO/ACP and both bear the date June 1, 2021. Material facts have been omitted in the charge sheet which has been filed in the court and which was supplied to the accused viz-a-viz those available with the Additional Public Prosecutor and the complainant,"" the judge noted.
The judge said that filing two distinct sets of charge sheets amounts to perjury, cheating, and interference with the justice dispensation process. ""It is treachery of the highest order,"" he said. ""The conduct of IO/SHO/ACP is perfidious and is reprehensible. Fraud has been played upon the court and this is a classic case of abuse of power by the police. Moreover, the police officials have prejudiced the right of the accused to a fair trial,"" he said.
The judge, in an order dated November 8, further rebuked the police by saying that there cannot be any bigger fraud committed upon the court and there cannot be a more prejudicial act than the one committed in the case.
""Let the copy of the order be sent to Commissioner of Police who is directed to initiate appropriate inquiry/legal action, register an appropriate case under appropriate provision of IPC against IO/SHO/ACP for committing fraud upon the court,"" the court said.
Furthermore, the judge noted that there were other lapses in the case which were also grave and serious and appear to be intentional.
The court summoned the DCP, IO, ACP, and SHO Jamia Nagar on the next date of hearing.
During the proceedings, Additional Public Prosecutor Ashok Kumar also told the court that he had brought several lapses to the notice of the Police Commissioner but they appeared to have fallen on deaf ears.
The case relates to the alleged rape and kidnapping of a 14-year-old girl. According to the charge sheet, the accused kept her in captivity for six days and raped her multiple times.

The Delhi Police had arrested 4 accused in the alleged rape, murder of a 9-year-old. (Representational)
New Delhi:
The forensic reports have not confirmed presence of semen on the clothes of four accused or the burnt cloth pieces of the nine-year-old Dalit girl who was allegedly gang-raped and cremated at Delhi Cantonment area in August, the Delhi Police have claimed in its charge sheet filed before a court.
The charge sheet filed on October 27 before Additional Sessions Judge Ashutosh Kumar also claimed that the forensic reports have so far not confirmed the presence of victim's blood on the clothes of any of the four accused or on the bedsheet on which the crime allegedly occurred.
The police had arrested Radhey Shyam, the 55-year-old priest of the crematorium in south-west district, and it's employees -- Kuldeep Singh, Salim Ahmad and Laxmi Narayan -- in the case.
The Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) report filed with the charge sheet further claimed that semen was also not detected from the bedsheet seized from the room of the accused at the crematorium.
However, the police said that Radhey Singh's blood was found from his shorts and handkerchief.
It said the entry made in the 'dead body entry register of cremation ground' on August 1 matched the specimen signatures of the accused, Shyam, who was the crematorium priest.
""Hence, it is evident that the entries in the register were made by accused Shyam,"" it claimed.
The police had earlier filed a charge sheet under sections 302 (murder), 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 376D (gang rape), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation), 201 (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of IPC, section 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) of POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and section 3 (offences of atrocities) of SC/ST Act.

Prince Raj was granted anticipatory bail by the trial court on September 25, 2021. (File)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Wednesday issued notice to Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), MP Prince Raj, on a plea moved by complainant challenging anticipatory bail granted to him by the trial court in an alleged rape case.
The bench of Justice Yogesh Khanna on Wednesday sought the response of member of parliament (MP) Prince Raj while posting the matter for February 17, 2022. The Complainant plea has been moved by Advocates Sudesh Kumari Jethwa and Deven Varun.
Prince Raj, president of the Bihar unit of the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), was booked in the national capital on September 9, this year for allegedly raping a former party member. Prince Raj was granted anticipatory bail by the trial court on September 25, 2021.
Trial Court Judge while granting bail had said, ""There being no requirement of custodial interrogation of accused, absence of an entry in the visitors' registers of Western Court, New Delhi regarding the visit of the prosecutrix on the date of incident and thereafter, in the month of March 2020, the possibility of false implication being prima facie established and there being no chance of tampering with the evidence or accused fleeing from justice, application for grant of anticipatory bail is allowed.""
""Having regard to the fact that there is an unreasonable delay in lodging the FIR by prosecutrix (Complainant), the present FIR being lodged by prosecutrix as a counterblast to the FIR lodged by accused against prosecutrix way back in February 2021, the admission made by prosecutrix that whatever happened between her and the accused was consensual in the transcript of audio recording dated August 27, 2020."", the court added in its order.
The court further directed to release the accused on his furnishing a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh with one surety in the like amount. The court also put on conditions LJP MP that he shall join the investigation as and when required by the IO and he shall not threaten, pressurize or contact the prosecutrix in any manner whatsoever i.e through phone, Whatsapp, Email, Instagram, Facebook, Messenger etc.
Delhi Police during the argument had opposed the plea of anticipatory bail petition of Lok Jansakti Party (LJP) MP Prince Raj Paswan. During the hearing in the court, Public Prosecutor submitted that we need custodial interrogation of him to recover the alleged video clips having objectionable content as claimed by the victim.
Senior Advocate Vikas Pahwa along with Advocate Nitesh Rana submitted that this is a case of honey trap and extortion. There is no rape victim here, it's a false case.
Lawyers for Prince Raj further argued that the rape case against his client is a frivolous case, his client is innocent. ""The complainant and her friend have been extorting him since 2020 and my client lodged an FIR of extortion in the Parliament Street Police Station on February 10 this year,"" he stated.
""She threatened to malign his reputation if he did not pay the extortion amount. He gave her Rs 2 lakhs but the extortion still continued. After the filing of FIR by my client, both the complainant and her friend had to take an anticipatory bail from the court,"" he added.
The woman, who claims that she was an LJP worker, has alleged that she was raped and molested while she was unconscious. An FIR was registered after the instructions of a Delhi court almost three months after the victim filed a complaint with the police in Delhi.

The woman had filed the complaint in 2020. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has acquitted suspended CRPF chief sports officer Khajan Singh -- Arjuna Awardee and Asian Games medalist -- and one other person in an alleged rape case filed by a woman constable, after she claimed to have levelled the accusations in a ""fit of anger"".
The 30-year-old woman had alleged that Khajan and suspended coach Sarjeet Singh were running a sex racket within CRPF, raped her for three years between 2014 and 2017, and threatened to make her nude photos viral. She had filed the complaint in November 2020.
She later retracted the statement and said that she had filed the complaint in a fit of anger after being thrown out of the department's wrestling team on the grounds of indiscipline for having an argument with a team member.
The woman deposed that Sarjeet was a member of the inquiry team who had disqualified her from taking part in the wrestling events and Khajan was the Chief Sports Officer in the CRPF department.
While acquitting the duo, Additional Sessions Judge Lokesh Kumar Sharma said that it was evident from her testimony that she was neither raped nor threatened by the accused person at any point in time.
In the September 16 order, the judge further noted that nothing incriminating came out in evidence against the accused even after her cross-examination by the public prosecutor.
""Complainant in her deposition admitted that she had made the complaint in a fit of anger. She admitted the fact that she was instigated by her colleagues. In view of her deposition, the accused could not be held guilty of committing rape upon her. Hence, the accused stand acquitted,"" the court sad.
Khajan Singh had won a silver medal at the 1986 Seoul Asian Games in the 200m butterfly event which was India's first medal in swimming at the event since 1951.
In April, the CRPF had suspended Khajan Singh and Sarjeet Singh after a preliminary probe found them guilty of sexual harassment of women personnel.

A woman has accused Prince Raj of raping her when he was unconscious
New Delhi:
Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) MP Prince Raj, seeking protection from arrest in a rape case, accused the complainant of extortion before a Delhi court today.
Ram Vilas Paswan's nephew and Chirag Paswan's cousin made the allegations before special judge Vikas Dhull who started hearing his anticipatory bail plea afresh today.
Special judge MK Nagpal recused himself from hearing the matter citing personal reasons on Tuesday when he was scheduled to pass an order on the application.
He sent the matter back to the District Judge, who assigned the case to a new court today.
The counsel appearing for Prince Raj, a Member of Parliament from Bihar's Samastipur, told the court that the alleged victim and her male friend were extorting and blackmailing his client since 2020.
Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa told the court that the woman and her friend had demanded Rs 1 crore and threatened to file a false complaint against Prince Raj if he failed to pay the money.
A case was earlier filed in that regard on February 10 this year in Delhi, in which the woman and her associate were granted anticipatory bail in July, he said.
Advocate Nitesh Rana, also representing Raj, told the court that on May 31, the woman had filed a complaint against his client for allegedly raping her.
She later approached the court seeking registration of an FIR against Prince Raj, following which the court had sought an Action Taken Report (ATR) from the police, he said.
In its ATR, the police submitted before the court that nothing was found on her complaint and that it was a matter of extortion, he said.
The police opposed the application and said Raj's custodial interrogation was required in the matter.
The police submitted before the court that it needed his custody to recover the alleged video clips with objectionable content as claimed by the woman.
The court will hear the matter further on Thursday.
The Delhi Police filed an FIR on September 9 against Prince Raj on the directions of a court.
The woman, who claims to have been an LJP worker, has accused Raj of raping her while she was unconscious.

She threatened to malign his reputation if he did not pay the extortion amount. He gave her Rs 2 Lakh but the extortion still continued. After the filing of FIR by my client, both the complainant and her friend had to take an anticipatory bail from the court,"" they said.

Prince Raj is the nephew of Ram Vilas Paswan and cousin of Chirag Paswan
New Delhi:
The Delhi Police today opposed the anticipatory bail plea of Lok Jansakti Party (LJP) MP Prince Raj in an alleged rape case and said his custodial interrogation is required.
The police submitted before special judge MK Nagpal that it needed Prince Raj's custody to recover the alleged video clips with objectionable content as claimed by the complainant.
Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa and lawyer Nitesh Rana, representing the MP, opposed the submission made by the police and claimed that the matter is that of honey trapping and extortion.
Prince Raj, the nephew of Ram Vilas Paswan and cousin of Chirag Paswan, is a Member of Parliament from Samastipur in Bihar.
Vikas Pahwa termed the case ""frivolous"" and told the court, ""There is no rape victim here. It's a false case.""
Nitesh Rana submitted before the judge that the complainant and her friend have been extorting from Prince Raj since 2020 and an FIR was registered in the Parliament Street Police Station on February 10 this year in this regard.
""She (complainant) threatened to malign his (Raj) reputation if he did not pay the extortion amount. He gave her Rs 2 lakh but the extortion still continued. After the filing of FIR by my client, both the complainant and her friend had to take an anticipatory bail from the court,"" he said.
The court will further hear the matter on Friday.
Prince Raj moved the application for anticipatory bail after a case was registered on the direction of a Delhi court on September 9.
On May 31, the woman filed a complaint against Prince Raj for allegedly raping her, the lawyer said.
Nitesh Rana said the woman later approached the court seeking registration of an FIR against Raj on her complaint, following which the court had sought an Action Taken Report (ATR) from police.
In its ATR, the police submitted before the court that nothing was found on her complaint and that it was a matter of extortion, he said.
The lawyer further claimed that in her own complaint field before the police in May, the woman did not appear before the police to help in the investigation.
The woman, who claims that she was an LJP worker, has accused Prince Raj of raping her while she was unconscious.

Lok Janshakti Party MP Prince Raj has been accused of rape.
New Delhi:
Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) MP Prince Raj, a cousin of Chirag Paswan, has been accused of rape in an FIR filed in Delhi on the complaint of a woman.
The woman, reportedly an LJP worker, had complained to the police in Delhi's Connaught Place three months ago that she had been raped and threatened by Prince Raj, an MP from Samastipur in Bihar.
The police filed a report based on the three-month-old allegation after a Delhi court ordered it on September 9. The woman had approached the court in July.
On June 17, Prince Raj had tweeted a statement denying what he called the allegations of ""a certain woman making defamatory statements"" claiming harassment and abuse.
""I categorically deny any such claim or assertion that has been made against me. All such claims are blatantly false, fabricated, and are part of a larger criminal conspiracy to pressurise me professionally and personally by threatening my reputation,"" the MP wrote.
""I am extremely saddened by these repeated and malevolent attempts to misuse the well-intended laws for the protection of women of our country,"" he had said.

He alleged that the woman had previously made similar allegations and that he had filed a complaint against her in February. He said an FIR was also registered on his complaint.
Chirag Paswan fell out with his cousin earlier this year when the LJP split and his uncle formed a breakaway faction with five of the six LJP MPs in the Lok Sabha. Prince Raj was among the five who rebelled.

The man's counsel said his client's case was repeatedly being rejected by the sentence review board
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has asked the prison authorities to file an affidavit stating why the correct facts relating to a man's conviction being modified from gang rape to the offence of rape were not placed before the Sentence Review Board (SRB).
The court directed the Delhi Prisons director general to file the affidavit also indicating the reasons why the SRB was informed that the case was for the offences of gang rape and robbery.
""In view of the fact that complete and correct facts were not brought to the notice of the SRB, Director General (Prisons) is directed to ensure that while putting up the case of the petitioner before the SRB in its next meeting, the judgment of conviction passed by the trial court as also the judgment of this court in appeal, whereby, the petitioner has been convicted only for the offence punishable under section 376 IPC and the gist thereof will be placed before the committee,"" Justice Mukta Gupta said.
The man's counsel told the court that though he was convicted for the offence of gang rape, the high court later modified the charge to rape based on an appeal but maintained the life imprisonment.
The counsel said the man's case was repeatedly being rejected by the SRB as correct facts were not placed before it by the authorities.
He further said the man's conduct in prison was exemplary, and he has not misused the concession granted to him in the form of parole and furlough.

Round-the-clock security has also been provided to the parents, the court was informed. (File)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court Tuesday sought a report from the police on the status of investigation into the alleged rape and murder of a nine-year-old Dalit girl in the national capital even as it was informed that an SIT has been set up to probe the case.
Justice Yogesh Khanna, who was hearing a plea by the parents of the victim girl for constituting a special investigation team (SIT) for a court-monitored probe, directed the police to file the status report before the next of hearing on November 8.
“Status report be filed so as to know the stage of the investigation,” the judge said.
Standing counsel Sanjay Lao, appearing for State, said that an SIT has already been constituted after the case was transferred from the local police station to Crime Branch.
""DCP, Crime Branch has constituted the SIT. There are two ACPs. The prayer has been fulfilled,"" Mr Lao said as he informed the probe was being monitored by the high-ranking officials of Delhi Police.
He added that two accused persons have admitted to the crime and provisions for alleged commission of offences of murder and rape under the Indian Penal Code, section 6 under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 have been added to the FIR.
Round-the-clock security has also been provided to the parents, Mr Lao informed the court.
With regards the parents' prayer to initiate a judicial inquiry into the administrative lapses in the case, Mr Lao contended that the same could be considered only after the conclusion of the investigation.
The court observed that in view of the State's stand, the prayers in the petition seemed to have been answered.
""The investigation is at a nascent stage. We can't direct judicial inquiry at this stage,"" the judge stated.
""When they have constituted the SIT, let them do their work. You can't presuppose (the outcome),"" the court observed during the hearing.
The court nonetheless directed that a status report be filed before the disposal of the petition.
In their plea, the parents of the victim have stated that they have “no faith in the present investigation” which has now been transferred to the crime branch of the Delhi Police.
""What type of SIT has been constituted? Nine days after the incident, police moved the application of custodial interrogation of the accused. What is this type of investigation by the so-called SIT?,"" questioned advocate Jitendra Kumar Jha, appearing for the parents.
The plea further sought adequate safety and security to them as well as the other witnesses in the case along with judicial inquiry into the lapses on the administrative front in the case in order to reveal the reason behind the delay in police response and ""why no vital evidence was preserved"".
They alleged that the “total focus of the police was to hush up/sabotage the case” and that the parents were ""tortured and pressurised by the police and its agent to compromise the case"".
The delay in registration of FIR that too under diluted offences itself indicates the police did not want to give justice, said the petition.
The parents have submitted that they belong to the poorest section of society and are illiterate and are under the force and influence of various groups with vested interest.
The minor Dalit girl died under suspicious circumstances on August 1 even as her parents alleged that she was raped, murdered and cremated by a crematorium's priest in southwest Delhi's Old Nangal village.

The court also awarded a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to the accused. (Representational image)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has acquitted a man accused of sexually assaulting minors, noting that the children were heavily tutored by their parents and that there is ample evidence to show that he was falsely framed due to ""caste hatred"".
District and Sessions Judge Dharmesh Sharma said that there is ample evidence to suggest that the accused was falsely framed due to the prejudicial disposition of the parents towards the accused, who belongs to the Dalit community.
""It is our experience in manning criminal justice delivery system that people level false accusations for myriad reasons, one of which is caste hatred as exemplified in appreciation of evidence in this case,"" he said in a judgment dated August 7.
The case was registered against the man in 2015 under the provisions of the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act for sexually assaulting the minor daughters of his neighbour. He was in jail since then.
The case clearly appears to be a result of ""heavy tutoring"" to implicate the accused with the allegations of repeated acts of sexual assaults at the behest of their parents, the judge said, calling it a sinister act done in the most shameless manner.
""In our society, there is a constant fight between the ''good'' and the ''evil'' and we are living in an age where the moral values in the society are degenerating and everything is possible,"" the district judge lamented.
The court directed a compensation of Rs 1 lakh to be paid to the accused by the state within two months, calling it a ""symbolic amount"".
He also pulled up the police and called their probe ""absolutely lackadaisical and lacking objectivity"", noting that they neither prepared a site plan nor made attempt to understand the locality in which the alleged events occurred.
""No reason is assigned as to why the statements of the victim girls under Section 161 CrPC were not recorded by a lady police official. The testimony of the IO reveals that he completely failed in the discharge of his duties to show fairness in his investigation against the accused,"" the court observed.
Notably, the parents of minors asserted that the accused used to lure the girls to his house and assault them, a claim refuted by him.
The accused, who has now been acquitted of all charges, told the court parents bore a grudge against him as dogs belonging to them defecated in front of his house and there were constant arguments over this.

Twitter India said Rahul Gandhi's tweet had violated the platform's policy too (File)
New Delhi:
During the hearing of a plea filed in Delhi High Court against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his tweet allegedly disclosing and sharing the identity of a rape victim's family in Delhi Cantonment area, Twitter India informed the court on Wednesday that they had removed Mr Gandhi's tweet and also locked his account.
""Rahul Gandhi's tweet violated our policy also, we have already removed that tweet and his Twitter account is also been locked,"" Twitter informed Delhi High Court.
The Twitter counsel further said, ""Petitioner has wrongly impleaded @TwitterIndia. We have removed it (Rahul Gandhi's Tweet). It is against our policy. That account is locked.""
After taking note of Twitter's submission, Justice DN Patel and Justice Jyoti Singh adjourned the matter for September 27.
The PIL sought Delhi High Court's directions to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) to take necessary legal action against Mr Gandhi for his tweet.
The petition also seeks directions to Delhi Police to register an FIR against Mr Gandhi under sections of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
The petitioner, Makarand Suresh Mhadlekar, who claims to be a social activist, had approached Delhi High Court seeking its intervention for appropriate legal action against the Congress leader for allegedly disclosing sensitive information about a rape victim and her family members by ""publishing a photograph of her parents on his Twitter handle"".
The petition, filed through advocates Gautam Jha, Shweta Jha and Pankaj, states that Rahul Gandhi has violated section 74 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 and section 23(2) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, both of which mandate that the identity of a child victim of a crime shall not be disclosed.
The plea said that the law in this regard is very well-settled in a catena of judgments including in the case of Nipun Saxena vs Union Of India wherein it was held by the Supreme Court, that the name, address, school or other particulars, which may lead to the identification of the child in conflict with law/victim, cannot be disclosed in the media.
""No picture of such child, or any such particular which can directly or indirectly disclose her identity, can be published. A child who is not in conflict with the law but is a victim of an offence, especially a sexual offence, needs this protection even more,"" the plea read.

Locals blocked the road demanding capital punishment for the culprits (File)
New Delhi:
The Delhi Police on Wednesday transferred a case of alleged rape and murder of a 9-year-old girl in the city's Old Nangal area to the Crime Branch, officials said.
The Delhi Police officer Chinmoy Biswal said the case has been transferred to the Crime Branch for an expeditious and scientific investigation.
The girl died under suspicious circumstances even as her parents alleged that she was raped and forcibly cremated by the crematorium priest in southwest Delhi's Old Nangal village. Only her burnt legs were recovered from the crematorium.
Based on the statement of the girl's mother, the rape charge was added to the FIR, the police said. Four people, including the priest, have been arrested.
Since Monday, agitated locals had blocked a stretch of road in the area demanding justice for the girl, who was allegedly raped and killed on Sunday.
The parents of the girl, along with several others, staged a sit-in near the site of the alleged crime on Tuesday and demanded capital punishment for the culprits.
The girl lived with her parents in a rented house in front of the crematorium. Around 5:30 pm Sunday, she went to get water from a cooler at the crematorium.
Around 6 pm, the crematorium's priest Radhey Shyam and two-three others called the girl's mother to the spot. Pointing out the girl's body to her mother, they claimed that she had got electrocuted while filling water from the cooler.
There were burn marks between her left wrist and elbow, and her lips were also blue.
The priest and the others dissuaded the girl's mother from calling the police, saying that the cops will make a case out of it and during the autopsy, doctors will steal the girl's organs, adding that the girl should rather be cremated.
Although she was cremated, her parents subsequently alleged that it was done without their consent. A crowd of around 200 villagers gathered at the crematorium and the police were called.

Minister Anurag Thakur questioned Rahul Gandhi's ""silence"" on rape incidents in Congress-ruled states.
New Delhi:
Union Minister Anurag Thakur on Wednesday questioned the ""silence"" of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on rape incidents in states ruled by his party after the opposition leader met the parents of the nine-year-old Dalit girl, who died after allegedly being sexually assaulted.
The Information and Broadcasting Minister was replying to a query on Gandhi's visit at a Cabinet briefing.
Mr Thakur said he would not like to comment on ""who went to meet the victim's family in Delhi or if it was for political reasons"".
He said when such rape incidents happen in many Congress-ruled states, some politicians like Rahul Gandhi have remained silent.
""It is unfortunate that they choose to see rapes and deaths of girls in those states where they are not in power and not in the states like Punjab and Rajasthan, where they have their governments,"" Mr Thakur told reporters.
""I feel that the law should ensure speedy justice to girls, be it from poor, rich or backward communities, and for this, the Modi government has made laws,"" he said.
The minister was referring to the cabinet decision to continue over 1023 fast-track special courts to ensure that victims of rape get quick justice.
Opposition parties have targeted Home Minister Amit Shah over the law and order situation.
The BJP, however, accused Rahul Gandhi of using the case for ""furthering"" his political agenda and asserted that the law and order machinery has moved swiftly to deliver justice to the victim''s family.
BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told a press conference that his party had no issue with Mr Gandhi, who visited the girl's family earlier, calling for justice but what was condemnable was the Gandhi family's ""selectivism"" as they never tweeted or spoke a word in the cases of atrocities against Dalit girls in the Congress-ruled states like Rajasthan, Punjab and Chhattisgarh.

Dalit Girl Rape-Murder Case: Arvind Kejriwal said his government will order a magisterial inquiry.
New Delhi:
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said the Delhi government will order a magisterial inquiry into the death of a nine-year-old Dalit girl following an alleged sexual assault.
He also announced a compensation of Rs 10 lakh for the family of the girl.
""Our girl cannot come back. The injustice done to the family is unfortunate and cannot be compensated, but the government will give Rs 10 lakh to them and order a magisterial inquiry into the matter,"" he told reporters after meeting the family.
The parents of the girl accompanied by hundreds of locals have been staging a protest near the site of the incident in southwest Delhi, demanding capital punishment for the accused.
When Arvind Kejriwal reached the area to meet the parents, the protesters mobbed the Chief Minister and started raising slogans against him.
The Chief Minister said that the government will appoint top lawyers to ensure the guilty get the harshest punishment. ""There is a need to strengthen law and order in Delhi. I appeal to the central government to take firm steps in this direction,"" he said.
""If the Centre needs our help, we will fully cooperate with them, but if such incidents happen in Delhi, it doesn't send a good message about the national capital across the world,"" Mr Kejriwal added.
The girl lived with her parents in a rented house. On Sunday at around 5:30 PM, she went to get cold water from a nearby water cooler after informing her mother, her parents said.
Around 6 PM, some people known to the girl's mother, called her and showed her daughter's body claiming that she got electrocuted while getting water from the cooler.
It was alleged that these people dissuaded her mother from making a call to the police, saying police will make a case out of it and during the post-mortem, doctors will steal the girl's organs, so it was better to cremate her.
Four people, including the priest of a crematorium, have been arrested in connection with the incident. The accused have been charged for rape and murder.
The Delhi Commission for Women has instituted an inquiry into the matter.
Stating that the case is ""very serious"" and merits ""urgent attention"", the panel has summoned the Deputy Commissioner of Southwest district to be present before it on August 5 and produce the complete case file of the matter along with a copy of FIR.

Delhi Rape-Murder: The child's family alleges she was raped and killed.
New Delhi:
Four days after a young Dalit girl's alleged rape and murder in Delhi and her cremation without her family's consent, the police have yet to establish the cause of her death. The crime has provoked spiraling shock and anger and has also drawn the attention of political parties in the middle of a tense parliament session.
The child's tiny rented home in a village in southwest Delhi is suddenly at the centre of media attention with politicians like Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Congress's Rahul Gandhi, Trinamool Congress leaders and others visiting the grieving parents.
On Sunday, the nine-year-old daughter of rag pickers went to a crematorium near her home to fetch drinking water but she never returned. She was allegedly gang-raped and murdered.
The family had gone to a local shrine and after their return, the girl's father had asked her to get some chilled water from a cooler at the crematorium. Around 6 pm, some people went to her home and told her mother that a priest at the crematorium, Radhe Shyam, wanted to talk to her.
When she reached, she saw the body of her daughter, allegedly with wounds all over, a cut, black lip and ""her tongue blue"".
She was told the child had been electrocuted. The priest allegedly went on to burn the body and ignored her pleading. She was the last to see the body.
""I was about to come back for help when he dragged me back and locked the door. No one could hear me shouting,"" the mother told NDTV.
""He told me go home and sleep...don't shout and cry about it.""
The priest and three others have been arrested and face charges under stringent laws that include sections on child sex abuse and crimes against scheduled castes and tribes.
The child's family alleges she was raped and killed. A senior police officer said today the postmortem was inconclusive and the four accused would face lie detector and drug tests.
The woman said when she first saw the body, she was in shock.
""I asked how she died. I told them to dial '100' and call the police. He (the priest) refused,"" said the mother.
""He pressured me to cremate the body immediately. He said if you call the cops there will be a long court case, my daughter would be taken to the hospital where the police and doctors would take out her organs and sell them. He said he would perform the cremation himself as I couldn't afford it.""
As the body was burnt, the family was kept away by the staff and asked to return the next morning for the child's ashes.
""My daughter has been raped. They made us sit aside, asking us to stay away as the flames were intense.""
The woman rushed out crying and her family tried to put out the funeral pyre but it was too late. ""I was told to return at 8 am to collect the ashes. I ran out and got my family...they tried to put out the fire using buckets of water,"" the mother wept.
Only the girl's feet could be salvaged.
In their extreme distress, the girl's parents were taken to the police station. ""We were beaten by the police. My husband and I were kept in separate rooms,"" the mother claimed.
But the police say they followed procedure.
Ingit Pratap Singh, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (South East Delhi), told NDTV: ""We needed to get her statement, wait for a social worker till 3 am and take it in front of a magistrate and that naturally took time. Only you are saying that we kept until next day but it was less than 24 hours.""
He also said the water cooler at the crematorium was found to have an electric current passing through it.
""Forensic examination of the water cooler found an electric current... In the beginning, the girl's family said death was due to electrocution. Accused have also admitted death occurred due to electric current,"" the senior cop told NDTV, adding that tests will also be conducted on the accused's clothes.
""We will present the charge sheet soon... there is 60 days to present it,"" he said.

The locals are holding a protest in the area demanding justice
New Delhi:
A nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped and murdered and her body forcibly cremated by her attackers in Delhi. The police have detained a priest in the case along with three others and investigations are on. The locals are holding a protest in the area demanding justice.
The child from an economically backward family lived with her parents in Purana Nangal in the Delhi Cantonment area, close to the crematorium. She had gone to the crematorium last evening to fetch drinking water from the cooler but never returned.
Around 6 pm, some locals who knew the cremation ground priest Radheshyam, called her mother to the crematorium and showed her the body.
They said she got electrocuted while drinking water from cooler. There were burn marks on the child's wrist and elbow. Her lips were also blue, her mother said.
The priest and his companions then told the girl's mother not to inform the police. Filing of a case would mean postmortem, where the child's organs will be stolen, they told her mother, suggesting that a cremation be held immediately.
Apparently they prevailed, locals speculate that the girl's parents were paid some money as incentive.
But later, the woman and her husband raised an alarm. Around 200 villagers of old Nangal village gathered at the crematorium and the police was informed.
Pratap Singh, a senior officer of the South West district police said they received a call about the case around 10.30 pm. A case has been filed with charges under the stringent laws against child sex abuse and crimes against scheduled castes and tribes.
The investigation is continuing.

A murder case was filed against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar in the case. (File photo)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has upheld the investigation conducted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that had ruled out any foul play in the Unnao rape survivor's accident in 2019.
In 2019, the rape survivor, her family, and lawyer were travelling in a car when it was hit by an overspeeding truck in Rae Bareli, killing two aunts and leaving her and the advocate critically injured.
Pursuant to this, a murder case was filed against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was also awarded life-term imprisonment for raping the minor survivor, and nine others after her family filed a complaint alleging ""conspiracy"" behind the accident.
Dismissing these allegations, District and Sessions Judge Dharmesh Sharma held that the objections of the complainant party read like an engrossing thrilling story but were based on mere surmises and conjectures.
He further said that there are no grounds to suspect the fidelity, accuracy, and sincerity of the investigation conducted by the CBI and that the agency came out with a plausible version of the incident.
Notably, the investigating agency had concluded that there was no evidence regarding criminal conspiracy hatched between those named in the FIR, including Kuldeep Sengar, and the truck driver or the cleaner or for that matter owner of the offending truck.
Upholding the probe, the judge stated in an order dated July 31, ""I have no hesitation in holding the findings of the CBI in the chargesheet, that there is no case against the accused persons so as to take cognisance and proceed against them under Section 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) read with Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), cannot be faulted.""
The sessions judge, however, framed charges against the truck driver for causing death by negligence and doing an act to endanger human life, besides framing charges of criminal intimidation against Sengar and his associates.
Besides this, on December 20, 2019, Sengar was sentenced to jail for the ""remainder of his natural biological life"" in a separate case for raping the minor in 2017.
On March 4, 2020, Sengar, his brother, and five others were also convicted for the death of the rape survivor's father in judicial custody and were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment.

Rape cases have seen a sharp rise in last five months. (Representational)
New Delhi:
Cases of rape and harassment of women in the national capital have increased by around 40 per cent in the first five-and-half months this year as compared to the corresponding period last year, while the total number of heinous crimes has gone down marginally, officials said on Tuesday.
According to data shared by them, cases of snatching have increased by 46 per cent in the period between January and June 15 as compared to the same duration last year.
According to the data, 2,315 cases of heinous crime, which includes dacoity, murder, attempt to murder, robbery, riot, kidnapping for ransom and rape, have been reported this time as compared to 2,436 last year.
Cases of murder, riot and kidnapping for ransom have reduced, while instances of dacoity, attempt to murder, robbery and rape have increased, they said.
A senior police officer said that last year, there was a complete lockdown due to which less number of cases reported. However, this year, there was no such nationwide strict lockdown and the data has increased as more people are filing complaints now online and more cases are being reported.
Between January 1 and June 15, the Delhi Police recorded 2,315 cases of heinous crimes -- seven of dacoity, 196 of murder, 295 of attempt to murder, 942 of robbery, 35 of riot, seven of kidnapping for ransom, and 833 of rape.
In the corresponding period last year, Delhi saw four cases of dacoity, 226 of murder, 236 of attempt to murder, 701 of robbery, 681 of riot eight of kidnapping for ransom, and 580 of rape.
The cases of rape have gone up by about 43 per cent this year, the officials said.
The cases of outraging modesty of women have increased by 39 per cent. This year, 1,022 such cases were registered as compared to 735 during the same period last year, they said.
The number of cases of insult to the modesty of women, kidnapping of women, abduction of women, cruelty by husband and in-laws and dowry death stand at 197, 1,580, 159, 1,712 and 56, respectively, it said.
However, last year the number of cases for the same was 146, 1,026, 46, 824 and 47 respectively, it said.
There is a huge margin in the number of cases of riot because communal clashes had broken out in northeast Delhi on February 24, 2020, after violence between the Citizenship (Amendment) Act supporters and its protesters spiralled out of control, leaving at least 53 people dead and over 700 injured.
The number of non-heinous crime, including snatching, hurt burglary, motor vehicle theft, house theft, have increased by over eight per cent.
In 2021, 1,20,980 cases of non-heinous crime have been reported, while the number was 1,11,419 in 2020, it said.
There were 1,217 more cases of snatching reported in 2021 as compared to last year. The data showed that 3,829 cases of snatching were reported in 2021 as compared to 2,612 in last year.
Among the total 1,20,980 cases, the number cases of hurt, burglary, motor vehicle theft and house theft stand at 493, 1,173, 15,667 and 938 respectively.

Hathras case: Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan was arrested in October last year
Lucknow:
A 5,000-page chargesheet has been filed by the Uttar Pradesh Police against Kerala journalist Siddique Kappan, who was arrested in October last year while travelling from Delhi to report on the aftermath of the alleged gang-rape and subsequent death in a Delhi hospital of a Dalit woman from UP's Hathras.
Seven others, three of whom were arrested with Mr Kappan, and the others arrested later, also face charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act or UAPA for alleged conspiracy to create communal tension.
Mr Kappan and three others were heading to Hathras to report on the alleged gang-rape of the woman - who died later in hospital - when they were arrested and charged under the anti-terror law. The UP Police said they acted on a tip about ""suspicious people"".
In the FIR (First Information Report), the police used a section of the UAPA that deals with ""raising funds for a terrorist act"". Mr Kappan has since been in jail in Mathura.
""We have not yet received a copy of the chargesheet. It's about 5,000 pages. Once we officially get a copy, we will study it and decide our course of action,"" said defence lawyer Madhuvan Dutt Chaturvedi told reporters outside the court in Mathura.
The UP administration's handling of the Hathras case was widely criticised. The police were accused of being slow to respond to the woman's complaint. After she died in hospital of her wounds, the police also controversially took away her body, drove to her village and cremated it at 2 am in the absence of her family.
The state administration's treatment of journalists and leaders who tried to visit Hathras, was similarly criticised.
The Central Bureau of Investigation later took over the case and filed a chargesheet against four accused. That trial is going on in a court in Hathras.
In December last year, the UP government told the Supreme Court that Mr Kappan claimed he was working as a journalist in a Kerala-based daily, but that newspaper shut down two years back.
The UP government has filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court claiming Mr Kappan was going to Hathras under the ""garb of journalism"" with a ""very determined design"" to create caste divide and disturb law and order situation.
The Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) has asked the Supreme Court for an independent inquiry by a retired judge to determine the facts of the alleged ""illegal arrest and detention"" of Mr Kappan. The KUWJ claimed that the Uttar Pradesh Police made an ""absolute false and incorrect statement"" that Mr Kappan is the office secretary of the Popular Front of India (PFI).

The woman alleged she was raped by the accused at a five-star hotel on February 20 (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has rejected the anticipatory bail application of a Mumbai based television journalist in a rape case, saying that consent cannot be implied from the complainant's previous experiences with the accused.
Special Judge Sanjay Khanagwal dismissed the application field by Varun Hiremath and said that if the woman stated in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not.
The 22-year-old woman alleged she was raped by Hiremath at a five-star hotel in Chanakyapuri on February 20.
The counsel for the 28-year-old accused told the court that there had been history of previous sexual relationship between the accused and the complainant.
The counsel had highlighted some WhatsApp and Instagram chats between accused and the complainant ""in order to show the love and passion between them for each other"".
Defence counsel had stated before the court that the complainant had disrobed herself and indulged in sexual acts with the accused and there had been no mark of resistance on her body which showed she never said no and always consented.
However, the judge said, ""On this point also I am of the view that prosecutrix in her complaint as well as in her statement under Section 164 CrPC specifically denied that the act was the consented one and she has repeatedly mentioned that despite her resistance and unwillingness, accused kept on doing the same to her and she not able to resist the same as she was fearing of some injuries due to the aggression in the behaviour of the accused.""
The court also noted in his order passed on March 12 that some WhatsApp chats of the accused and the survivor after the alleged offence indicated ""towards the feeling of sorry by the accused of his acts"".
It said the question of consent coupled with the conduct of complainant and accused was a matter of trial and that it was only considering the anticipatory bail plea.
Although WhatsApp and Instagram chats have not been specifically denied by the prosecution, the fact that they were having relationship and indulged in sexually explicit talks will not make a difference at this stage in view of Section 53A of Indian Evidence Act, the court said.
The section provides that evidence of character or previous sexual experiences is ""not relevant in certain cases including the offence under Section 376 (rape) and this provision specifically shows that previous sexual experiences with any person shall not be relevant on the issue of such consent or the quality of consent"", it said.
""Therefore, from her previous experiences with the accused the consent cannot be implied,"" the court said.
The court further stated that as per law, ""So far as the question about the consent or no consent, if the woman states in her evidence before the court that she did not consent, the court shall presume that she did not consent.""
The court held that based on the evidence collected by the investigating officer (IO) till today in the form of complaint, statements recorded by the complainant and WhatsApp and Instagram chats and written transcripts were sufficient to say that ""this is not a case where such presumption appears to be absent"".
""IO has stated about the requirement of custodial interrogation of the accused for the purpose of further investigation in this matter.
""Therefore, considering the nature of accusation made against the accused, evidences collected by the IO against him and the facts and circumstances, gravity of offence and discussion made hereinabove, I am not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to the accused,"" the judge said.
The judge, however, said that the opinion expressed at the stage of bail ""does not tantamount to expression on the merit of this case"".
On the basis of woman's complaint, an FIR under IPC sections 376 (punishment of offence of rape), 342 (punishment for wrongful confinement) and 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) was registered at Chanakyapuri police station.

The Supreme Court Monday stayed the ongoing trial against Bahujan Samaj Party MP Atul Rai in a rape case and sought his response on the plea of the alleged victim seeking transfer of the case from Prayagraj to Delhi on grounds including threat to her life.
A bench of Justice Surya Kant took note of the submissions of lawyer Rakesh Mishra, appearing for the woman, and issued notice to the MP from Ghoshi Lok Sabha constituency seeking his response within four weeks.
""The Court is convened through Video Conferencing. Application seeking permission to file the Transfer Petition is granted. Application seeking exemption from filing official translation of Annexure is allowed. Issue notice returnable within four weeks.
""Meanwhile, proceedings in Criminal Case pending before the Special Judge (MP/MLA) Court, Allahabad (Prayagraj), UP shall remain stayed,"" the bench said in its order.
A case was lodged in 2019 in Varanasi by the woman and the MP was arrested subsequently.
""That on December 18, 2020, when the victim went for court hearing with her witness. Both were beaten inside the court premises at Prayagraj and for which another FIR ..has been lodged at Colonelganj Police station at Allahabad,"" the lawyer said.
Fearing threat to her life and also that she will not get a fair trial in a special court at Prayagraj, the plea seeking transfer of trial to Delhi has been filed, the lawyer said.
Earlier in January last year, the top court had refused to interfere with the Allahabad High Court order, which had granted two-day parole to Atul Rai for taking oath as Member of Parliament in New Delhi.
Atul Rai, who had won the 2019 Lok Sabha polls on a BSP ticket from Ghosi parliamentary constituency in UP, is in jail in connection with the rape case.

The dynamic and scientific strategy to control crime has resulted in a sharp decline in heinous crimes,"" Praveer Ranjan, Special Commissioner of Police, Crime and Economic Offences Wing said.
Cases of dacoity decreased by 40 per cent in the national capital, murder by 9.40 per cent and kidnapping for ransom by 26.67 per cent in 2020.

472 cases of murder were registered during 2020, as compared to 521 cases in 2019.
""Out of these, 89.62 per cent cases were solved. Incidents of murders per lakh of the population have shown a significant decline during the last fourteen years coming down to 2.37 per cent in 2020 from 3.05 per cent in 2005.

The major percentage share of total IPC is due to e-FIR. These e-FIRs include FIR of MV thefts, property theft and other theft. During 2019, 2,33,191 e-FIR were registered which contributed aout 77 per cent of total IPC cases. During 2020, 1,64,308 e-FIR were registered which contributed about 66 per cent of the total IPC registered in Delhi.

A Promise of marriage can't be held out as inducement for engaging in sex, court said.
New Delhi:
Ruling that a promise of marriage cannot be held out as an inducement for engaging in sex over a protracted and indefinite period of time, the Delhi High Court has dismissed an appeal filed by a woman challenging the acquittal of an accused in a rape case observing that her relationship with the accused was consensual.
A single-judge bench of Justice Vibhu Bakhru said inducement to have a physical relationship by promising marriage and the victim falling prey to such inducement may be understandable in the context of the moment.
""A promise of marriage cannot be held out as an inducement for engaging in sex over a protracted and indefinite period of time,"" the bench said in its order dated December 15.
Noting that it did not find any infirmity with the conclusion given by the trial court, the bench said a bare reading of the complaint made by the appellant as well as her testimony clearly indicates that even according to her, her relationship with the accused was consensual.
The bench also ruled the allegation that her consent has been vitiated on account of having been obtained by misrepresentation, is clearly, unsustainable.
""As noted by the trial court, according to her complaint, the appellant woman has stated that she had a physical relationship with the accused in 2008 and after three or four months, thereafter, he had promised to marry her and she had eloped with him,"" the bench noted.
""In view of the said statement, her allegation that her consent to engage in sexual activity with the accused, is vitiated, as the same was secured on a promise to get married, is not sustainable,"" it said.
The complainant had also alleged that she had conceived on two occasions, however, the accused did not want any children and therefore, had brought medicines, which had led her to abort the pregnancy.
""However, in her cross-examination, she could not recollect the date or the time when such miscarriages had taken place. Concededly, there is no other evidence, which would establish that the appellant had miscarried on being administered any drugs,"" the bench said.
""The present appeal is also filed after an inordinate delay of six hundred and forty days. There is no credible explanation for such delay. The only explanation provided is that the accused has once again starting interfering with the complainant's life and therefore, she seeks to revive her complaint. Clearly, the same presents no ground for condoning such delay,"" it added.
The woman had challenged a trial court order dated March 24, 2018, whereby the accused was acquitted of the offences punishable under Section 417 (cheating) and 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC). She had in August 2015, filed a complaint in the Malviya Nagar police station in the matter.

New Delhi:
For millions of individuals worldwide, the year 2020 was a series of unforeseeable events. From coronavirus to cyclones to tension at Indian borders and economic disruptions, the entire year contained world-changing and paradigm-shifting developments. In India, the pandemic, protests and political face-offs, dominated the news space. As 2020 comes to an end, here are the top 10 contentious political developments.
Farm Laws:
Farmers Protest: Police personnel use water canons on farmers to stop them from crossing the Punjab-Haryana border.
In September 2020, both the houses of parliament passed the farm bills amid protests by the opposition parties and a longtime ally of the ruling party. Opposition legislators raised slogans, tore documents and tried to grab the speaker's microphone in the upper house of parliament before bills were passed by a voice vote. While the government said the law will make it easier for the farmers to sell their produce directly to big buyers, the Opposition slashed the bills and called them ""anti-farmer"" and ""pro-corporate"". On September 24, the controversial bills got the President's assent and they became laws. And with it, the political face-off too intensified. While the Opposition continued to attack the government, and urged to repeal the ""black"" law, the government accused the Opposition of ""misdirecting"" the farmers.
Delhi Riots:

Protesters for and against the controversial citizenship law clashed in Delhi killing 53 people and injuring over 200. The violence came mere hours before United States President Donald Trump was expected in Delhi. Protesters threw stones, set vehicles and shops ablaze and transformed parts of the national capital into a war zone, forcing the deployment of security personnel to ban large gatherings in affected areas respond with lathicharge and tear gas shelling. Within a few days of the unfortunate incident, the political blame game too kicked in. While Congress president Sonia Gandhi demanded the resignation of Union Home Minister Amit Shah, under whose control Delhi Police rolls up, Mr Shah said Congress had no right to point fingers at any party, given its track record. The political tension deepened with Mrs Gandhi calling the riots ""conspiracy"" and Union ministers hit back by saying ""politicising this violence is wrong"". Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Centre too had a face-off over the Delhi riots where the statements by political leaders focused on blame-game rather than confidence-building measures.
Actor Kangana Ranaut Vs Maharashtra State: 
Actor Kangna Ranaut at the Chandigarh International Airport, from where she departed for Mumbai, on September 9, 2020.
Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut's statement on Mumbai police created a political divide. Ms Ranaut locked horns with Maharashtra's ruling Shiv Sena and its party leaders after she expressed her distrust in the Mumbai Police in view of actor Sushant Singh Rajput's death. The actor also compared Mumbai with Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK). While the Congress, Shiv Sena and other parties slammed the actor for her remarks and asked her not to return to Mumbai, BJP and one of its ally backed the film star. The verbal tussle became dramatic with Centre approving Y+ security cover for the 33-year-old actor and Shiv Sena-led Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) demolition parts of her Mumbai office.
India-China Clash Along LAC In Ladakh
Indian and Chinese soldiers were locked in a stand-off in eastern Ladakh, along the Line of Actual Control.
20 Indian soldiers were killed in action, and 76 injured, after a clash with Chinese troops that started late in the night on June 15. The violence, the first to claim lives since four Indian soldiers were killed in Arunachal Pradesh in 1975, led to a rapid escalation of tension between the two countries. There were casualties on the Chinese side as well, but the numbers have not been declared by Beijing.
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and other leaders soon launched a series of attacks on the government over the ""violent clashes"". While Mr Gandhi accused PM Modi of ""surrendering"" to Chinese aggression along the border, BJP slammed the leader for trying to politicise the issue by making statements that are ""weak on facts"" and ""strong on mudslinging"". Mr Gandhi also asked the Centre why soldiers were sent ""unarmed to martyrdom"". Hitting back at Mr Gandhi, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar told him to get ""the facts straight"". Mr Jaishankar said that the army cannot use firearms during faceoff as per 1996 and 2005 agreements. He also added that is why the Indian soldiers refrained.
Ram Temple Foundation Ceremony Amid Pandemic
Prime Minister Narendra Modi performs Bhoomi Pujan at Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir, in Ayodhya.
On August 5, coincidentally the first anniversary of the revocation of special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir, PM Modi laid the foundation stone for the construction of a Ram Mandir. Calling it a day that marked the freedom of Ramjanmabhoomi from the chain of ""destruction and resurrection"", PM Modi said that it is an emotional moment for India. However, the event faced severe criticism from the opposition parties. NCP chief and former Union minister Sharad Pawar hit out at the groundbreaking ceremony for being scheduled in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Hyderabad MP and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi questioned PM Modi's invitation as the chief guest for the ceremony. He said it is a violation of PM's constitutional oath and goes against the secular fabric of the country.
Late Night Cremation Of Hathras Rape Victim
The Hathras victim was cremated in the middle of the night in her village.
In September, the politics over the alleged gang-rape by four upper-caste men escalated when UP Police ""unceremoniously"" cremated the victim of the Hathras rape case around 3 am without the consent of the family. Furthermore, UP police, which comes under the state government, didn't let media or opposition party leaders meet the victim's family. However, after a dramatic episode, Congress leaders Priyanka Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi met the family of the victim in their second attempt. While the BJP said the Congress doesn't care about the welfare of the people and has a ""political agenda"" in everything it does, the Congress accused the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh of being insensitive in dealing with the incident and the protests that followed.
""Love Jihad"" Law
At a rally in Jaunpur, Yogi Adityanath warned those waging ""love jihad"" to mend their ways or be prepared for their last journey.
The anti-religious conversion law, which came into force in the form of an ordinance on November 28, is seen as giving legal teeth to the BJP's battle against so-called 'love jihad', the unproven conspiracy theory that Hindu women are being falsely enticed and converted by Muslim men. When Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's government okayed the ordinance, proposing a maximum punishment of 10 years for ""love jihad"" related offences, it triggered a political row.
While BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis said incidents of ""Love Jihad"" were taking place in the country and therefore, laws to curb the practice were justified, the Opposition accused the governing BJP of pursuing ""communal agenda"". BSP President Mayawati too asked UP government to reconsider its new anti-religious conversion ordinance. ""The new ordinance introduced in haste by the UP government against love jihad is riddled with doubts since religious conversion through compulsion or fraud has found no acceptability or respectability anywhere in the country,"" The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief said in a Hindi tweet.
Palghar Mob Lynching
On April 16, two sadhus were killed by an angry mob of villagers in Palghar, Maharashtra.
Barely 125 kilometres from Mumbai, a small village in Maharashtra's Palghar district reported a horrific case of mob lynching in April. Three people, including two Sadhus, were attacked and killed after rumours that they were kidnapping children to harvest organs, including kidneys. The incident placed former Maharashtra allies BJP and Shiv Sena against each other at a time when the nation was fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. First the BJP attacked the Sena over the Palghar killing, then the Sena hit back after two sadhus were murdered at a temple in UP, a state ruled by the BJP. Condemning the lynching of the two sadhus (sages) in the neighbouring Palghar district, the Shiv Sena said the incident was an attempt to malign Maharashtra's image and it was ""inhuman"" to give it a communal colour. Opposition came down heavily on Uddhav Thackeray government and criticised its handling of the case. The Shiv Sena condemned the killings and said it was ""inhuman"" to give it a communal colour.
Migrant Crisis:
Thousands of migrant workers are waiting at Delhi's Anand Vihar Bus Terminal to be ferried home.
Migrant workers faced multiple hardships because of the coronavirus-induced lockdown across the nation. The major Opposition parties questioned the Centre's ""poor"" handling of the pandemic and sought compensation for the migrant workers who died during the lockdown. To repair its image dented by the allegations, the ruling BJP soon took various measures to help migrants and later arranged transport for them. Congress also raised the migrant crisis issue, to attack the NDA, during a poll rally Bihar in Bihar. Speaking on the crisis of lakhs of migrants forced to walk to their states after losing their homes and jobs in the coronavirus lockdown, Mr Gandhi said: ""He says he bows before mazdoors (labourers) but when they really need him, he does nothing. You kept walking, thirsty and hungry, for thousands of kms, but Modi-ji did not give you trains. The (government) said you die, I don't care.""
Online Streaming Services Brought Under Centre's Regulation:
Digital and online media now part of Information and Broadcasting's regulatory framework.
In November, the government issued an order bringing online mediums, including films and news content, under the ministry of information and broadcasting. Meaning online streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, among others would be now regulated by the Centre. It soon became a social media frenzy with critics claiming that the move will have adverse consequences as it could kickstart an era of more frequent and stricter censorship on online content. Several Bollywood filmmakers too criticised the government's order and called it ""unacceptable"". Karan Anshuman, director of 'Inside Edge', and 'Mirzapur' tweeted that viewers and creators should come together and challenge censorship.

A trial court had imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on Kuldeep Singh Sengar. (File)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court Monday granted time to the CBI to file status report on disqualified Uttar Pradesh MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar's appeal challenging his conviction and 10-year imprisonment in the custodial death case of the Unnao rape victim's father.
Justice Anu Malhotra directed the agency to submit its reply within two weeks to the plea and listed the matter for further hearing on January 12.
The High Court on November 6 issued notice to the CBI on Sengar's appeal against his conviction and jail term and had also asked the agency to respond to his application seeking suspension of the sentence till pendency of the appeal.
During the hearing, CBI's counsel sought more time to file the status report saying that the investigating officer of this case is also probing the UP's Hathras rape case due to which he could not file the reply.
Advocate Kanhaiya Singhal, representing Sengar, submitted that he has a strong case for suspension of sentence and let the CBI file its reply then he would advance his arguments.
Sengar, who was also sentenced to the ""remainder of his natural biological life"" for raping the minor Unnao girl, was stripped of his membership on February 25 as the lawmaker of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly following his conviction in the rape case.
The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Sengar in the Arms Act and had died in custody on April 9, 2018, owing to police brutalities in custody.
On March 4, Sengar, his brother and five others were convicted for the death of the victim''s father in judicial custody by the trial court which on March 13, sentenced them to 10 years imprisonment.
The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on Sengar.
He has sought setting aside the verdict of the trial court by which he was convicted and sentenced in the case.
In the appeal, he said, ""It is imperative for a fair trial that the investigating agency, prosecution and witnesses present the true facts before the court and that the court, in turn, must ensure that a free and fair trial...""
It said the trial must not only be fair but also remain free from biases and prejudices. It would not be preposterous to submit that in the instant case neither the justice was done nor seen to be done which has certainly shaken the confidence of the public in the entire justice delivery system.
Sengar claimed this case was an offshoot of a long-drawn political rivalry and deep-seated animosity existing between two political factions.
The trial court, which did not hold the accused guilty of murder under the IPC, awarded maximum sentence for the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder to convicts under section 304 of the IPC after holding that there was no intention to kill.
It had said ""no leniency"" can be shown for killing a family's ""sole bread earner"".
The trial court, which sentenced all the convicts to maximum punishment under sections culpable homicide not amounting to murder and some other offences under the penal laws, also said that the four daughters and a son of the dead has lost the protective cover of their father.
Besides ten years in prison for culpable homicide, Sengar, his brother, the then in-charge of Makhi Police Station in Unnao Ashok Singh Bhadauria and then sub-inspector K P Singh, Vineet Mishra, Birendra Singh and Shashi Pratap Singh have been also sentenced for other offences.
They were held guilty for the offences of criminal conspiracy, punishment for false evidence, giving false information respecting an offence committed, causing disappearance of evidence of offence, false charge of offence made with intent to injure, voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful restraint under the IPC and under the Arms Act.
The court had earlier acquitted other accused -- constable Amir Khan, Shailendra Singh, Ram Sharan Singh and Sharadveer Singh -- giving them the benefit of doubt in the custodial death case.
On December 20 last year, Sengar was sentenced to jail for ""remainder of his natural biological life"" in a separate case for raping the minor daughter of the dead in 2017.
The case was transferred to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1 last year.

Kuldeep Sengar, who was also sentenced to the ""remainder of his natural biological life"" for raping the minor Unnao girl, was stripped of his membership on February 25 as the lawmaker of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly following his conviction in the rape case.
The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Sengar in the Arms Act and had died in custody on April 9, 2018 owing to police brutalities in custody.
On March 4, Sengar, his brother and five others were convicted for the death of the victim's father in judicial custody by the trial court which on March 13, sentenced them to 10 years imprisonment.
The trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs 10 lakh on Sengar.

Hathras Case: The CBI team visited the woman's village on Tuesday.
New Delhi:
The Uttar Pradesh government today requested the Supreme Court t to monitor the CBI probe into the alleged gang rape and torture in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras of a 20-year-old Dalit woman, who died at a hospital in Delhi last month, adding that the state government is ""committed to provide complete security to victims' family and witnesses"".
The Central Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday began probe into the case, with a team of CBI officials visiting the woman's, about a month after she was allegedly gang raped by four men of a so-called upper caste community.
The UP government also requested the top court to direct the central probe agency to submit fortnightly status reports to the state government  so that the same can be filed in Supreme Court through the police chief.
Giving details of the security provided to the woman's family, the UP government, in its affidavit in the top court, submitted a list of police personnel posted for security in Hathras, including outside her home.
Eight CCTV cameras have been installed outside her home to keep a watch and the police has ensured that there is no intrusion of privacy of the family, Uttar Pradesh said.
The Supreme Court will take up the case tomorrow.
The CBI team on Tuesday visited the millet field in the UP village where, according to the victim's brother, the accused tried to strangle the 20-year-old woman. The victim's mother, who was unwell, was also taken to the crime scene by the CBI officials when she was returning home in an ambulance after a brief hospital visit.
The CBI officials were accompanied by a forensic expert, police personnel and the woman's brother. The team left the crime scene after over two hours. Later, the team visited the site where she was cremated at 2:30 am.
The CBI team is headed by Deputy Superintendent of Police Seema Pahuja, who has earlier handled the Shimla rape-murder case.
The Uttar Pradesh police and administration, meanwhile, faced tough questions from the Allahabad High Court on Monday about the way they handled the case and the middle of the night cremation of the woman.
The court questioned whether the case would have been treated differently had the woman, instead of belonging to a poor family, came from a rich one.

The CBI took over the Hathras case last week on Saturday.
Hathras, Uttar Pradesh:
The CBI today began probe into the alleged gang rape and torture of a 20-year-old Dalit woman, who died at a hospital in Delhi last month two weeks after the savage assault that triggered massive outrage across the country. A team of CBI officials visited the victim's village this afternoon, about a month after she was allegedly gang raped by four men of so-called upper caste.
The team visited the millet field in the UP village where, according to the victim's brother, the accused tried to strangle the 20-year-old woman. The victim's mother, who was unwell, was also taken to the crime scene by the CBI officials when she was returning home in an ambulance after a brief hospital visit.
The CBI officials were also accompanied by a forensic expert, police personnel and the victim's brother. The team left the crime scene after over two hours. Later, the team visited the site where the victim was cremated.
The woman's brother later told reporters that he accompanied the CBI team for three hours while they collected samples and got him to sign on them. But the investigators did not interrogate him, he added.
""We can't say anything about the CBI probe which has just begun.  We were asked to recall the sequence of events. We are satisfied with the security arrangements,"" another of her brothers told NDTV.
The CBI team is headed by Deputy Superintendent of Police Seema Pahuja, who has earlier handled the Shimla rape-murder case.
Hathras Case: The CBI officials were also accompanied by a forensic expert, police personnel and the victim's brother.
A special investigation team (SIT) was formed on September 30 by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, which was supposed to file its report in seven days. Later, it got an extension of 10 days.
The case, however, has been taken over by the CBI that filed a First Information Report (FIR) on Sunday.
The CBI registered the FIR in the Hathras case under sections 376-D (gang rape), 307 (attempt to murder) and 302 (murder) of the IPC and Section 3 of the SC/ST Act (offences of atrocities).
The state government and the UP Police have come under heavy criticism over the Hathras case.
A large part of that criticism has been about the government's handling of the case, including its treatment of the young woman's traumatised family - whom they allegedly locked up in their home while they hastily cremated their daughter at night.

Hathras Case: The Hathras woman's family placed three demands before the Allahabad High Court.
Lucknow:
The family of a young woman who died last month after her torture and alleged gang rape at a village in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras has asked for the case to be moved out of the state. According to the family's lawyer, this was among the three demands placed before the Allahabad High Court, which heard the case on Monday.
""The family wants the case to be transferred to Delhi or Mumbai,"" lawyer Seema Kushwaha told reporters, according to Press Trust of India.
She also said the family had urged the court to stop reports of the investigation being made public.
The case will be heard again on November 2. The family told reporters later that they would not immerse the woman's ashes until they got justice.
At the hearing, the Uttar Pradesh police and administration faced tough questions about the way they handled the case and the middle of the night cremation of the 20-year-old, who died of horrific injuries from the assault by four upper caste men from her village on September 14. The investigation has been taken over by the CBI, which visited the village on Sunday and returned after collecting some documents.
The family, among the few Dalits in their village, has been given protection at the village after it complained of intimidation by the upper caste Thakurs. In court yesterday, they asked for more security, alleging they felt unsafe.
The district administration justified the woman's cremation in the absence of her family; her parents and brothers had been locked up in their home when she was cremated at 2.30 am. The police refused to hand over the body even though her parents begged to take her home one last time and perform her funeral the next morning.
Hathras District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxar said there was ""no pressure from the state government"" to carry out the cremation in that manner, implying that the local authorities took the controversial decision. He said the police had reasons to take the step for the sake of law and order, an argument that was challenged by the family.
The court questioned whether the case would have been treated differently had the woman, instead of belonging to a poor family, came from a rich one.
""The court asked the District Magistrate - 'What if it was a girl from a rich family? Would you have cremated her the same way?"" Seema Kushwaha told NDTV.
The high court had summoned top UP administration and police officials as well as the victim's family, taking up the case on October 1 amid nationwide outrage over the woman's assault, her death and the way she was cremated.
The woman's parents and three brothers travelled to Lucknow under heavy security for the court hearing.

Hathras case: The family left from Hathras for Lucknow, about 380 km away, early this morning.
Amid tight security, the family of the 20-year-old woman - allegedly gang raped and tortured in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras - will today appear before the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court. The woman died at a hospital in Delhi last month, two weeks after the alleged assault and torture that triggered widespread outrage.
The family left from Hathras for state capital Lucknow, about 380 km away, early this morning. ""I am going with them. Proper security arrangements have been made. The district magistrate and superintendent of police is also accompanying us,"" Anjali Ganwar, Sub Divisional Magistrate, was quoted as saying by news news agency ANI.
The UP Police on Sunday assured about the security arrangements around the victim's home. ""There is sufficient security for the victim's family. The local police is in touch with the family and nearby villages. Officials have been conducting peace meeting in the nearby villages and appealed to them not to pay attention to the rumours,"" senior police officer Vineet Jaiswal told ANI.
The 20-year-old woman from Hathras was allegedly gang raped and assaulted by four ""upper caste"" men from her village. The state government has come under heavy criticism over the handling of the case that many have compared to the 2012 gang rape in Delhi, which called for stricter laws. A large part of that criticism has been about the treatment of the young woman's traumatised family allegedly locked up in their home while the victim was hastily cremated.
""Shocked"" by the alleged gang rape and murder of the 20-year-old woman and her forcible cremation by the police subsequently, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court on October 1 had summoned top government officials to the court.
A division bench of Justice Rajan Roy and Justice Jaspreet Singh had ordered the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary, state police chief and an additional director general of police to appear before it to explain the incident. The bench also ordered Hathras district magistrate and superintendent of police to appear to brief the court, including the ongoing probe into it.
""The incidents which took place after the death of the victim on September 29, 2020, leading up to her cremation, as alleged, have shocked our conscience. Therefore, we are taking suo moto cognizance of the same,"" the court had said in its order.

Rahul Gandhi has been attacking the government over the Hathras case.
New Delhi:
Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who had visited Hathras in Uttar Pradesh last week amid outrage over the alleged gang rape of a 20-year-old woman, this morning attacked Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in a tweet. The brutal torture of the 20-year-old Dalit woman has triggered nationwide outrage; she died at a hospital in Delhi last month.
""The shameful truth is many Indians don't consider Dalits, Muslims and Tribals to be human. The CM & his police say no one was raped because for them, and many other Indians, she was NO ONE (sic),"" the ex-Congress chief wrote in a tweet this morning, along with a news report that said the police had been denying the rape charges.
The 20-year-old woman was allegedly assaulted by four men of her village on September 14. She died two weeks later after sustaining horrific injuries in a savage assault that many have compared to the 2012 gang rape in the national capita
The UP government has been criticised for the handling on the case and a late-night cremation where her family was allegedly not allowed. The police, meanwhile, have filed 19 FIRs (First Information Reports) - not against the accused - but against ""unknown people"" for a conspiracy to defame the state government.
Last week, Mr Gandhi had visited the victim's family, two days after he was stopped by the UP Police while marching to Hathras. Dramatic visuals showed him in a tussle with UP cops; he was pushed and he fell to the ground.
The central government, meanwhile, on Saturday  reminded state and UT governments of existing laws for ""mandatory action by police in cases of crimes against women"".

An FIR was registered on September 21 on the complaint of the girl's father. (Representational)
Aligarh (Uttar Pradesh):
Even before the outrage over the gang rape-murder case of a Dalit woman in Hathras settled, a four-year-old girl from the district, who was allegedly raped by her relative, died during treatment at a hospital in Delhi, police said Tuesday.
The minor was held captive at a relative's house in Iglas area of Aligarh district and was rescued on September 17, Senior Superintendent of Police Muniraj G said.
""On a complaint by a social organisation police raided the house, which belonged to a relative of the victim, found the girl and admitted her to Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College hospital where she was being treated till four days ago,"" the SSP told reporters.
The girl was shifted to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital after her condition deteriorated and she died on Monday.
A medical examination on the girl confirmed rape.
An FIR was registered by police on September 21 on the complaint of the girl's father, a resident of a village in Hathras district, that he suspected the girl was raped in captivity. Police then arrested the 15-year-old relative who confessed to his crime, the SSP said.
""The boy's mother, who is the maternal aunt (mausi) of the victim, is reported to be an accomplice in the crime and is missing,"" he said.
On Tuesday, the victim's family sat with her body on the main road in Hathras in protest against the failure of the police to arrest the woman. After persuasion by senior police officials, they agreed to conduct the last rites.
The SSP said the Iglas police station SHO has been suspended for negligence.
He also said two police teams have been constituted to trace the woman.
The incident has come to light amid a widespread outrage over the death and alleged gang rape of a Dalit woman in Hathras by four ""upper caste"" men and the Uttar Pradesh administration's response to the incident.
The woman's family alleged the body was burnt at night without their approval, but the local police said the cremation was done ""as per the wishes of the family"". Citing an FSL report, the Hathras police also claimed that the woman was not raped.
The UP government has requested the Centre to order a CBI probe into the incident as ""fake narratives were being spread about the case with political motives"". On Tuesday, it told the Supreme Court the CBI probe may be conducted under its supervision.

UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has handed over the Hathras case to the CBI.
New Delhi:
A journalist, who is a contributor for a popular Kerala-based website, and three other men were arrested in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura on Monday over alleged links to the Popular Front of India or PFI, an outfit the Yogi Adityanath government wants banned.
The four men were headed from Delhi to Hathras, where a 20-year-old woman was allegedly gang raped and tortured last month, in a car when they were stopped and arrested, police said.
According to the cops, the four men - Atiq-ur Rehman, Siddique Kappan, Masood Ahmed and Alam - were stopped at a toll after they received information that some ""suspicious people were on their way to Hathras from Delhi"". Their mobile phones, a laptop and some literature, ""which could have an impact on peace, and law and order in the state"", have been seized, a statement said. The men, during questioning, revealed they had links with the PFI and its associate organisation Campus Front of India (CFI), the police claimed.
The alleged gang rape of the 20-year-old woman, who died in Delhi last week, has triggered widespread outrage.
Siddique Kappan, a journalist, had ""gone to Hathras on Monday to cover the present situation in the area,"" the Kerala Union of Working Journalists said in a statement. He is also the secretary of the journalists' body's Delhi unit.
In a letter, addressed to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the journalists' body urged for his release ""at the earliest"". 
""We understand that he was taken into police custody by Uttar Pradesh police from Hathras toll plaza. Our efforts and the efforts by some advocates based in Delhi to contact him were not successful. The Hathras Police Station and the State Police department has not provided any information so far on taking him into custody,"" the letter read.
Mr Kappan, in the past, has been reportedly linked to the PFI but he had sent a legal notice to the people who had made the allegations.
KN Ashokan, editor of a popular Malayalam website Azhimukham, who worked with Mr Kappan told NDTV: ""He is a contributor with our website. As far as my knowledge goes, he does not have any such links (to PFI). He informed us yesterday (Monday) morning that he was going to Hathras. After that we were trying to reach out to him, but we could not. We got to know about the detention from reports.""
Last year, the UP government sought a ban on the PFI over its alleged links to the statewide protests against the citizenship law, which was called ""anti-Muslim"" by several opposition parties and critics.
Nineteen FIRs have been filed over the Hathras incident by the Uttar Pradesh police, facing criticism over the handling of the case. The police has alleged an attempt to disturb peace in the state and listed sedition, conspiracy and promoting religious hatred in the main FIR or First Information Report filed in the incident.
As several opposition leaders demanded Yogi Adityanath's resignation, the Chief Minister, apparently targeting the rivals over the issue, on Sunday tweeted: ""Those who do not like development, they want to incite ethnic and communal riots.""

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad visited Hathras on Sunday and held a massive protest.
New Delhi:
Bhim Army chief Chandrashekar Azad and 400 others have been accused of violating ban on large gatherings after he visited Hathras in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday to meet the family of a 20-year-old who was allegedly gang raped and tortured; she died at a hospital in Delhi last week. A case has been filed against all these people by the UP Police. 
The Bhim Army chief, also known as ""Raavan"", held a massive protest on Sunday after he was stopped twice by the UP Police when he was on his way to meet the victim's family. Visuals showed him standing on a truck, addressing a huge crowd. 
On being asked about the case against the Bhim Army chief, Joint Magistrate Prem Prakash Meena  today said: ""Police would know better about it.""
Chandrashekar Azad was allowed to meet the family on Sunday after huge protests, however, he was told he could take only 10 people along. 
When he was stopped for the first time, about 20 km from Hathras, he marched for around 5 km, along with his supporters, to cover the distance to reach the victim's home. A video showed them carrying flags and raising slogans against the government.
As he met the family on Sunday evening, he demanded Y-Plus category security for them. ""When Kangana Ranaut can be given Y-plus security, meetings are being held to back the accused... I demand that the government arranges Y-Plus category security for the victim's family. We have all seen that the CBI follows the government's orders,"" he told the reporters. 
He also urged the administration to let him take the victim's family along with him; the request, however, was turned down. 
Chandrashekhar Azad's Hathras visit came a day after the Congress leaders - Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - met the family at their home.
On Friday, the Bhim Army chief joined a protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar where hundreds of people came with placards and shouted slogans against the incident, which has sparked massive outrage.
Several opposition leaders were stopped from going to Hathras last Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were stopped when they made their first attempt to meet the victim's family. The next day, Trinamool Congress's Derek O'Brien and several other TMC leaders said they were manhandled ""just 1.5 km from the victim's home.""

Chandrashekar Azad on Friday held a protest in Delhi against the Hathras incident. (File)
New Delhi/ Hathras:
Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad this evening met the family of the 20-year-old woman who died in Delhi after alleged gang rape and torture in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras. The Bhim Army chief marched for about five km after he was stopped by the police for the first time when he was on his way. He was stopped again when he entered Hathras and was told ""not all the people accompanying him could go along"".
Demanding Y-Plus category security for the family, Chandrashekar Azad this evening said: ""When Kangana Ranaut can be given Y-plus security, meetings are being held to back the accused... I demand that the government arranges Y-Plus category security for the victim's family. We have all seen that the CBI follows the government's orders."" 
""Under the present leadership, the CBI is being used only to scare people. We want a probe monitored by a retired Supreme Court judge,"" he added.  
Yogi Adityanath on Saturday had handed over the case to the CBI.
Chandrashekhar  Azad also held a massive protest when he was stopped by the UP Police for a second time when he had entered Hathras. Visuals showed him standing on top of a truck and addressing a massive crowd.
Another video showed Chandrashekar Azad, wearing a white kurta, marching with other members of the Bhim Army. The protesters, carrying flags, raised slogans against the government.
The Bhim Army Chief, also called ""Raavan"",  urged the administration to let him take the victim's family along with them, a request that was turned down,
Chandrashekhar Azad's Hathras visit comes a day after the Congress leaders - Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra - met the family at their home.
On Friday, the Bhim Army chief joined a protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar where hundreds of people came with placards and shouted slogans against the incident, which has sparked massive outrage.
""Our struggle will continue till Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister [Yogi Adityanath] doesn't resign and justice is not served. I urge the Supreme Court to take note of the incident,"" he said at Jantar Mantar.
The Bhim Army also led a protest earlier this week outside Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where the young woman died of horrific injuries suffered in the assault.
""In the same Uttar Pradesh that elected him and sent him to parliament, there is brutality against a daughter from Hathras. She was raped and murdered... her bones broken and body cremated like garbage. When there is human rights violation in Uttar Pradesh, does not the Prime Minister say a word?"" Chandrashekhar Azad had said earlier in an emotional message, attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi - an MP from UP's Varanasi.
Several opposition leaders have been stopped from going to Hathras this week. On Thursday, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were stopped when they made their first attempt to meet the victim's family.
The next day, Trinamool Congress's Derek O'Brien and several other TMC leaders said they were manhandled ""just 1.5 km from the victim's home.""

""I am a teacher along with being an MLA. Such incidents (like rape) can be stopped only with sanskar (culture), not with shasan (good governance) or talwar (referring to sword or might),"" the BJP's Surendra Singh said on Saturday.
""It's my dharma, government's dharma but family's dharma too... While government is committed to protect, the family should be committed too to imbibe good values in their children. Sanskar and sarkaar can make India beautiful, there is no other alternative,"" he is heard saying in a video. He was replying to a question by a reporter, who asked him: ""Why do you think rape cases continue even as people say this is Ram Rajya?"" 
The BJP MLA has been known for making controversial comments in the past. Last year, he had said that Nathuram Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi ""was not a terrorist"" and he ""committed a mistake"". Earlier this year, he commented on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, saying she is a ""cruel-hearted woman"". 
His comments come as the opposition leaders continue to attack the Yogi Adityanath government over the handling of the case. On Saturday, ex-Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the victim's family in Hathras, two days after they were stopped by the UP police from marching to the village.
""No force can silence us,"" Mr Gandhi told the media after the meeting, vowing to keep up their pressure on the government till the family gets justice. ""Wherever something wrong happens, we will be there to ensure justice is served. No one can stop us,"" Priyanka Gandhi said.
Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday handed over the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation , hours after two top officials - DGP HC Awasthy and Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Awanish Awasthi - visited the family.
In the midst of massive criticism against the state government, this was the first visit by high-ranking officials of the government and police since the alleged gang rape that took place on September 14.

Hathras Gang Rape: Over 200 policemen at the DND Flyway near Delhi as Rahul Gandhi heads to Hathras.
New Delhi:
More than 30 MPs left for Hathras in Uttar Pradesh this afternoon along with ex-Congress chief Rahul Gandhi amid nationwide outrage over the alleged gang rape and torture of a 20-year-old woman who died at a hospital in Delhi on Tuesday. Later, however, only two of them - KC Venugopal and Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury - were allowed to go with the Gandhis.
Mr Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra left from Delhi in a car, two days after both the Congress leaders were stopped while marching to the village in UP where the victim's family lives.
Visuals this afternoon showed Ms Vadra, 48, driving the car and Rahul Gandhi, wearing a white kurta and mask, sitting beside her. The police allowed them to go today after stopping them briefly and stressing that ""only five leaders will be allowed to go"". 
More than 200 cops - some in riot gear and wielding lathis - were deployed at the toll plaza along the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) Flyover. As crowds gathered, cops were seen resorting to lathicharge to disperse the people. 
Several Congress MPs, in separate vehicles, were headed to Hathras.

In a tweet, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor shared his picture, behind the wheels and wrote: ""Heading to Hathras! #SatyagrahaForOurDaughters.""
Earlier today, Congress MP Ghulam Nabi Azad had attacked the UP government over the tussle between Rahul Gandhi and UP cops on Thursday.
""Leadership and its mindset have been demonstrated by what all is happening,"" Mr Azad said. Rahul Gandhi was pushed and he fell to the ground when he was stopped by the policemen on Thursday, who had thwarted his march.
Ghulam Nabi Azad's remarks came as he was preparing with several other Congress leaders to head to the UP village.
""Photo opportunity kaun karta hai yeh sabko malum hai (Everybody knows who indulges in photo opportunity,"" the Rajya Sabha MP had told reporters, when asked about the criticism against the visit of the Congress leaders to UP.
Thursday's dramatic visuals showing Rahul Gandhi on ground - surrounded by a large number of cops - had prompted attack by the opposition leaders.
""Reckless behavior of UP police towards Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is extremely condemnable. It is reprehensible for those who are supposed to uphold the law to trample upon democratic values in such a manner,"" tweeted NCP leader Sharad Pawar.

New Delhi:
It is the Uttar Pradesh government's responsibility to protect the family of the alleged gang rape victim, said Congress leader Rahul Gandhi after meeting with the family in Hathras. Mr Gandhi, along with party general secretary and sister, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, spoke with the family of the 20-year-old Dalit woman who died in Delhi after allegedly being gang raped and tortured in Hathras. The woman's body was then cremated in the dead of night by the police in a secretive ceremony.
""Wherever something wrong happens, we will be there to ensure justice is served. No one can stop us,"" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said.
Congress leaders Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury KC Venugopal also accompanied Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to Hathras.
The Uttar Pradesh government had previously insisted that large gatherings - such as those of the Congress delegation - were not allowed in line with Covid management guidelines. These orders prohibit people from travelling in groups of more than five.
This was the Congress leaders' second attempt to reach Hathras - the first, on Thursday, ended in a tussle with cops who refused to let Mr Gandhi pass, citing orders banning large gatherings amid coronavirus concerns, and shoved him to the ground in the chaos that followed.

Jantar Mantar: Bhim Army supporters and opposition party leaders also protested in Delhi
New Delhi:
A group of Youth Congress workers marked Mahatma Gandhi's 151st birthday on Friday with a unique protest, dressing up as the icon himself and demonstrating at Jantar Mantar in Delhi against the alleged gang rape and murder in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras.
They were seen carrying placards and posters that said, ""You haven't merely burnt a girl under the cover of darkness, but humanity itself,"" according to news agency ANI, referring to the hasty 2:30 am cremation by the UP police.
Activists of the Youth Congress also took out a candlelight vigil to pay homage to the woman and demanded justice for her.
The march led by Youth Congress president Srinivas BV began from the organisation's headquarters on Raisina Road and ended at Jantar Mantar.
The protest at Jantar Mantar had around 500 people taking part, including Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury, and Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad. They were demanding justice for the 20-year-old Dalit woman who died on Tuesday following an assault by four men from a so-called ""upper-caste"" community.
The woman had reportedly suffered fractures, paralysis, and a spinal injury during the assault.
Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, meanwhile, attended a prayer meet at the Valmiki Temple in Delhi on Friday.
Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's BJP government in Uttar Pradesh has faced searing criticism over the state's handling of the case.
The police there have also cordoned off the woman's family in Hathras from the media and political leaders, a move that drew criticism even from senior BJP member Uma Bharti.
""I request you to allow media persons and other political parties to meet the aggrieved family,"" Ms Bharati said in one of her tweets addressed to Mr Adityanath on the issue.

Jantar Mantar: Bhim Army supporters and opposition party leaders protested in Delhi
New Delhi:
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and their supporters came to Delhi's Jantar Mantar on Friday evening in protest against the government for what they say not doing enough to stop crime against women. Hundreds of people including leaders from opposition parties also gathered there to demand justice in the alleged gang rape and murder case of a 20-year-old woman in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras.
""We have assembled here in grief. I pray to God that our daughter's soul gets peace. I request the Uttar Pradesh government with my hands folded, hang the guilty as soon as possible. They should get such a punishment that no one will dare commit a crime like this again,"" Mr Kejriwal said.
""I will visit #Hathras. Our struggle will continue till the time UP CM doesn't resign, & justice is served. I urge SC to take cognizance of the incident,"" Mr Azad tweeted.
After sunset, the protesters lit up candles and stood holding them in the dark, as policemen watched over them.
The Delhi Police had imposed restrictions on crowds at India Gate, after which Mr Azad said the agitation had been shifted to Jantar Mantar, 3 km away. While the police order said only 100 people would be allowed at Jantar Mantar, at least 500 turned up at the protest this evening.
""The UP government has no right to stay in power. Our demand is that justice should be served,"" said CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury, who attended the protest.
""The silence of the central government and the top leadership of the BJP on such a heinous crime and the UP government's response thereafter speak volumes about the authoritarian and anti-democratic chehra, chaal, charitra, and chintan of the ruling party,"" he said.
The date of protests was significant - Friday was Gandhi Jayanti, or the anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, who was among the first to fight for oppressed members of the so-called lower castes.
The 20-year-old woman, who died on Tuesday, suffered fractures, paralysis and a spinal injury after a savage assault by four men from the so-called upper castes. The police said there was a gash in her tongue because she had bitten it while being strangled.
Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday attended a prayer meet at Delhi's Valmiki Temple organised amid nationwide outrage over the alleged rape and murder of the 20-year-old Scheduled Castes woman.
""We will ensure justice for our sister. We won't sit quietly till she does not get justice,"" she said, addressing a crowd of Congress supporters and demonstrators.
""The government did not help at all. Her family is feeling helpless. We will put political pressure on the government. She wasn't even given a cremation following Hindu customs,"" Ms Vadra said.
The opposition party has been at the fore of demonstrations against the incident that has put Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP, which rules at the centre and in UP, on the receiving end of growing public outrage.

New Delhi:
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad, along with a crowd of hundreds, gathered in Delhi's Jantar Mantar today in protest against the Hathras case. ""We have assembled here in grief. I pray to God that our daughter's soul gets peace. I request the Uttar Pradesh government with my hands folded, hang the guilty as soon as possible. They should get such a punishment that no one will dare commit a crime like this again,"" Mr Kejriwal said. Chandrashekhar Azad demanded answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the gang rape and murder of a 20-year-old Dalit woman from Uttar Pradesh's Hathras - whose body cops then cremated at 2.30 am - in a crime that has outraged the nation.
Earlier today, Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra today offered prayers at a Valmiki temple in Delhi where a prayer meeting was organised by the party's Delhi unit in the wake of the Hathras incident. The Congress has asked its party leaders to organise prayer meetings in Valmiki Temples across the country as the victim who was killed in Hathras belonged to the scheduled caste.
The 20-year-old who died on Tuesday had suffered multiple fractures, paralysis and severe spinal injury when she was assaulted by four men of the so-called upper castes from her village on September 14. The police said there was a gash in her tongue because she had bitten it when the men were trying to strangle her.
The brutality to the woman and the post-midnight funeral by the police has triggered a widespread outrage.
Here are the Highlights on Hathras Protest:

Trinamool Congress slams ''jungle raj'' in UP after its delegation stopped from meeting Hathras victim's family
The TMC on Friday lashed out at the Uttar Pradesh government for unleashing ""jungle raj"" in
the northern state, after its four-member delegation was stopped from meeting the family members of Hathras gang-rape victim.

The BJP unit of West Bengal, however, asked the TMC to stop ""politicising the death"" and take a look at its own track record when it came to tackling crimes against women.

A statement issued by the party said the delegation, led by the party's Rajya Sabha MP Derek O' Brien, wanted to meet the family members of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, and
express their solidarity with her grieving parents. Dr Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Pratima Mondal and Mamata Thakur, all parliamentarians, were the three other members of the delegation.

Condemning the incident, TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee claimed that the Yogi Adityanath government has let loose a reign of terror and ""crossed all limits of decency"".

""Is it a democracy? MPs are being heckled and pushed to ground. How come police officers have this audacity to heckle members of Parliament? The state government, which has failed to protect to a Dalit girl and is busy hushing up the matter, is now using brute force against opposition,"" he said.

Delhi Police has imposed Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) around India Gate, which prohibits assembly of five or more people at a time.

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad called for a protest over the Hathras gang rape and murder (File)
New Delhi:
Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad today demanded answers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the gang rape and murder of a 20-year-old Dalit woman from Uttar Pradesh's Hathras - whose body cops then cremated at 2.30 am - in a crime that has outraged the nation. He also joined a protest in the evening at Jantar Mantar in central Delhi, where hundreds of people came with placards and shouted slogans; Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is also expected to attend.
""I will visit Hathras. Our struggle will continue till Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister [Yogi Adityanath] doesn't resign and justice is not served. I urge the Supreme Court to take cognisance of the incident,"" he said at Jantar Mantar.
Earlier, in an emotional message, Mr Azad - whose Bhim Army led a protest earlier this week outside Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital where the young woman died of horrific injuries suffered in the assault - lashed out at the Prime Minister and said his silence was ""a danger for our daughters"".
""In the same Uttar Pradesh that elected him and sent him to parliament, there is brutality against a daughter from Hathras. She was raped and murdered... her bones broken and body cremated like garbage. When there is human rights violation in Uttar Pradesh, does not the Prime Minister say a word?"" he asked.
Prime Minister Modi is a Lok Sabha MP from UP's Varanasi.
""Neither can the Prime Minister hear her screams nor her family's screams. How long will you stay silent, Prime Minister? You will have to give answers. Today, at 5 pm, we are coming... to demand answers. Your silence is a danger for our daughters,"" he added.
Chandrashekhar Azad told the Prime Minister ""you will have to speak... you will have to give answers and you will have to ensure justice is delivered"". 
Mr Azad called for a protest at the iconic India Gate in central Delhi at 5 pm.
Shortly afterwards, acknowledging that Delhi Police has imposed restrictions on crowds in the area, Mr Azad said the agitation had been shifted to 5 pm at Jantar Mantar, which is around three kilometres away.
The ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in Delhi tweeted a rallying cry in support of a protest that prompted cops to ban large crowds around India Gate.
Bhim Army protesters agitated outside Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital
This is the second time Mr Azad has called on the Prime Minister, who so far has not commented on the Hathras tragedy, to speak out. Speaking to NDTV Mr Azad asked: ""How come the Prime Minister hasn't commented?"" and, taking on the Yogi Adityanath government, added: ""Don't expect justice in Uttar Pradesh"".
The date of protests is significant - today is Gandhi Jayanti, or the anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, who was among the first to fight for oppressed members of the so-called lower castes.
Mr Azad's Bhim Army also protested outside the Delhi hospital where the woman died, highlighting the caste angle in a vicious attack that has drawn comparisons to the 2012 Delhi gang rape.
On Thursday Mr Azad demanded President's Rule in UP, alleging ""failure of constitutional machinery"" in the state over crimes against Dalits.
He also said he has started a protest at his home in UP's Saharanpur where he had been placed under ""house arrest"" as ordered by local police the day before.
The 20-year-old woman, who died Tuesday suffered fractures, paralysis and a spinal injury after a savage assault by four men from the so-called upper castes. The police said there was a gash in her tongue because she had bitten it while being strangled.

Balrampur Gang Rape: Two people have been arrested in the case, the police said.
Lucknow:
Amid outrage in the country over the gang rape and death of a young woman in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, another similar case has been reported from the state. A little more than 500 km from Hathras, a 22-year-old Dalit woman died after being allegedly raped and assaulted on Tuesday evening, when the attention of the country was focused on the events in Delhi as the police tried to take away the Hathras woman's body from Safdarjung hospital.
The young woman in Balrampur had died while being taken to a hospital in Lucknow. The police, meanwhile, have said that two accused in the case have been arrested, but also claimed that the post-mortem has not revealed injuries to the woman. The police has not spoken officially on whether rape has been confirmed by a medical examination.
""A complaint was filed by the brother that two accused in the case, Shahid and Sahil, raped the woman and then, when her condition became serious, they sent her home on a rickshaw. The relatives says she died on the way to hospital. The police have registered a case of murder and gang rape and both accused have been arrested and are being jailed. Some media channels are running that her hands, feet and waist was broken but there is no mention of this in the post mortem,"" senior police officer Dev Ranjan Verma said.
The woman's mother said she was abducted in the morning while on way to secure a college admission. When she failed to return in time, the family launched a search for the woman. 
The family says she returned around 7 pm, and that the assailants had allegedly put her on an e-rickshaw and sent her home, sources said.
""The men had injected her with some substance due to which she lost consciousness. Then they raped her... They broke her legs, they broke her back. A rickshaw-wallah brought her home. They was thrown in front of our house. My child could barely stand or speak,"" the woman's mother said, weeping.
""Somehow, crying, my daughter said, 'Save me, I do not want to die',"" the mother said.
She added that soon after her return, her daughter complained of a burning pain in her stomach.
""The doctor at the local hospital said her condition is serious and advised that she be taken to Lucknow. But she died when we were near Balrampur town,"" she added.
The police handed over her body to her relatives who cremated her on Wednesday.
The police, however, said the autopsy does not reveal that her hands and legs were broken. ""In the said case, prompt action has been taken by the police with both the accused arrested.  Details that hands and legs were broke is not true The post-mortem report does not mention this,"" Balrampur Police tweeted late last night.
The police, citing the woman's family, said there were marks on her hand for injecting glucose. ""Her hands had a glucose syringe sticking out. She appeared to be in a very bad condition,"" officer Dev Ranjan Verma said.
""The family has named two persons. They said they took her to a doctor to get her treated and raped her. When her condition got worse, they sent her home instead of sending her to hospital. The police has taken swift action and arrested the two named. We will ensure swift action,"" the officer said.
In a video tweeted by the Balrampur Police this morning, the District Magistrate, the top police officer of the district and local leaders are seen meeting with the  family of the woman. They handed over Rs. 6.18 lakh to the family as ""compensation"".
""The family members were assured that the accused will be given a strict punishment in accordance with law. A letter sanctioning a financial assistance of Rs 6,18,450 was handed over to them by the mahant (of a famous local temple). The amount will be sent to the victim's mother's bank account by the afternoon,"" a statement issued said.
Former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav made a jibe at the Yogi Adityanath government, asking it to not ""attempt a cover-up"" as in the Hathras case.
""After Hathras, another gang rape incident has surfaced in Balrampur in which the woman died after torture. The BJP government should not attempt a cover up here like Hathras and should quickly take action against the accused,"" his tweet in Hindi read.
The Hathras woman, who was also a member of the Scheduled Castes, was attacked on September 14 when she had gone to cut grass for fodder. Her assailants had left her in the in the fields half strangled, bearing multiple fractures, tongue gashed, naked, bleeding and paralysed.
Her body was cremated by the Uttar Pradesh police in the middle of the night. Her family was kept locked up and not given a chance to bring her home for the last time and give her last rites.
The state has been under huge criticism and public anger is growing over issue.
Congress president Sonia Gandhi launched a scathing attack on the Yogi Adityanath government this evening, saying the Hathras woman was ""killed by a ruthless government"" that was trying to ""hush up the matter"".
Strong comments have also come from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Bahujan Samaj Party's Mayawati and Shiv Sena's Sanjay Raut.
The National Commission of Women has demanded a report from the state government and a plea has been filed in the Supreme Court, seeking an investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation or a Special Investigation Team.

A 20-year-old woman died Tuesday after her gang-rape and torture by four men in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras.
New Delhi:
There was blood flowing out of her mouth when the mother of the 20-year-old woman, who died in Delhi on Tuesday two weeks after she was gang-raped and tortured in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, found her naked body in the fields on September 14.
The Hathras victim's mother told this to NDTV hours after the Uttar Pradesh police hurriedly cremated her daughter in the dead of the night against the family's wishes or allowing them a last look. The woman detailed her daughter's plight and the family's ordeal over the last 15 days.
The extent of the woman's injuries - multiple fractures, paralysis caused by spinal injury and a gash in her tongue - has led to the parallels being drawn with the Nirbhaya gang-rape. In 2012, a medical student was gang-raped and fatally assaulted on a moving bus in Delhi, leading to outrage and protests across the country.
""We were working in the fields when they dragged her away. I was cutting grass and she had moved away to collect it. When I turned to look, I couldn't find her. I shouted and hunted for her and spotted one of her slippers. There were drag marks near it. I followed them to find my daughter lying naked with blood coming out of her mouth; she wasn't being able to talk, her tongue had been slashed,"" the woman told NDTV.
The woman added they were sent away from the local police station when they went to file a complaint. ""We went to Hathras and then to Aligarh; my daughter couldn't talk so they didn't file a case of gang-rape,"" she said.
She added that on Tuesday night, the police beat the women and others with lathis when they tried to stop them from cremating her daughter. ""We had to even lock ourselves in our house because the police were chasing us to beat us and take us away. We got scared,"" the woman told NDTV.
The UP Police is under scrutiny over alleged lapses throughout the case.
According to the family, the police had at first accused the woman of lying about her injuries. The police had initially registered an attempted murder case but added rape charges only after the woman's formal statement a week after the incident, when she was able to speak. On Tuesday, a senior officer said rape had not been confirmed and they were waiting for a forensic report.
There have also been allegations of delay in taking the woman to a bigger medical facility despite the seriousness of her injuries.
While some officials have claimed the family refused to shift her, the woman's sister-in-law was seen questioning Hathras MLA Rajvir Singh Diler in front of reporters. ""Why was she kept in a general ward for seven days?"" she asked.
Amid nationwide outrage over the incident Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said a three-member panel has been set up to investigate the crime and a report would be submitted within seven days.
He added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for the ""strictest action against the accused"" in the gang-rape and torture of a 20-year-old woman in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras.
Four men have been arrested for gang rape. They will also be tried for murder.

Hathras Gangrape Case: The woman died in Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital yesterday morning.
Hathras, Uttar Pradesh:
A 20-year-old woman, who died on Tuesday in Delhi two weeks after she was gang-raped and tortured in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, was cremated by policemen last night, allegedly as her family and relatives were locked up in their homes. A disturbing sequence of events captured in overnight visuals shows the family arguing with cops, female relatives throwing themselves on the hood of the ambulance carrying the body and a mother weeping helplessly as cops insist on taking her daughter straight to cremation, without allowing a last look.
The woman died in Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital yesterday morning. She had suffered multiple fractures, paralysis and a gash in her tongue in the horrific assault that drew parallels to the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape. But long after her death, her family had to endure a night of unending horror.
As protesters outside the Delhi hospital chanted ""hang the rapists"", the woman's brothers complained that her body had been whisked away by the UP police without their knowledge.
Her father and brothers sat on protest but they were taken away by the cops in a black Scorpio with UP plates.
 Hathras Gang Rape: UP rape victim's family and relatives were allegedly locked up in their homes.
The woman's body was taken to her village in Hathras, about 200 km from Delhi, after midnight. As her family and villagers suspected the UP police wanted to complete the last rites right then, in the middle of the night, they insisted that this was ""against their tradition""; the woman's father pleaded with the police to be allowed to take her home and cremate her in the morning.
""We wanted the last rites to be performed according to the Hindu traditions. Despite our protests, the cremation was performed. They took the body forcefully. We couldn't see our daughter's face for the last time,"" the woman's father told NDTV. 
Hathras Gang Rape: A woman, believed to be the mother of the 20-year-old, sat on the road sobbing and beating her chest.
At the village, female relatives tried to block the vehicle by hugging the bonnet. A woman, believed to be the mother of the 20-year-old, sat on the road sobbing and beating her chest.
The police vehicle was stopped at multiple points before the cops allegedly pushed the protesters away and drove towards the funeral ground.
 Hathras Gang Rape: Relatives were seen throwing themselves on the hood of the ambulance carrying the body.
Appeals were also made to District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar to take her body to her home for last rites after daybreak.
At 2:30 am, while most of her family was home, the police cremated the body.
Continuing their inexplicable acts, the Hathras police formed a human chain to keep reporters, the family and villagers away. Only cops were present. Her family could not see her one last time. They were allegedly locked up at home.
Amid spiraling outrage, the Hathras police claimed the cremation was carried out with the family's consent and some members were present. It turned out to be one uncle - not her parents - who was called and shown the cremation.
Hathras Gang Rape: The police vehicle was stopped multiple times.
""We have videos of family members present there. I will be happy to share with media. We performed the cremation after the family's consent. Some members of the family were present at the cremation. The media reports are not true,""  District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar said today. 
All four attackers, upper caste men from the woman's village, are in jail. They will now also be charged with murder.
The UP police, which is under scrutiny over alleged lapses throughout the case, has been accused of rushing the cremation in a desperate cover-up attempt. 
According to the family, the police had at first accused the woman of lying about her injuries. The police had initially registered an attempted murder case but added rape charges only after the woman's formal statement a week after the incident, when she was able to speak. Yesterday, a senior officer said rape had not been confirmed and they were waiting for a forensic report.

Swati Maliwal urged Lt Governor to file chargesheet in both matters within next 3 days
New Delhi:
Delhi Commission For Women chief Swati Maliwal on Wednesday wrote to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to ensure that the police file chargesheets in the rape cases of a 12-year-old girl and an 86-year-old woman within three days.
She also urged Mr Baijal to ensure exemplary punishment of death penalty to the culprits in both the cases in a fast tracked manner. A 12-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted last month while an 86-year-old woman was raped on September 7.
""The minor has suffered untold miseries and grievous injuries on her private parts and still continues to be hospitalised in AIIMS. The 90-year-old woman, who was raped the day before yesterday, has also been subjected to vicious beatings and gruesome rape by a 37-year-old man. She continues to be in deep trauma,"" she said in the letter. The Delhi Police has registered FIRs in both the matters and has arrested the concerned men, Ms Maliwal said.
""Since these cases are really distressing and brutal, I appeal to you to kindly look into the matter and ensure exemplary punishment - death penalty to the culprits in both the cases in a fast tracked manner,"" she said.
Ms Maliwal urged him ""to issue necessary orders to police to file the chargesheet in both matters within next three days and also direct suitable arrangements for speedy trial of the cases ensuring the completion of trial in two months"".
""I plead your hon'ble self to try and ensure the strongest action against the culprits in both these cases,"" she added.
Ms Maliwal said she had met both the survivors and ""can never ever forget their pain and trauma"". The families of the survivors also want that their cases be fast tracked and the perpetrators be given the capital punishment, she added.
It's unfortunate that in today's times females of all ages whether it's an eight-month-old baby, a 12-year-old girl or a 90-year-old woman are all unsafe, she said, adding that ""there is a complete lack of fear of law in the minds of criminals and the laxity of the system emboldens them to commit gruesome crimes against women and girls in the country"".
""The justice delivery mechanism in the country is painfully long and cumbersome which more often than not breaks the spirit of the girl or woman who has been raped,"" the letter said.

Unnao Rape Case: Court directed authorities to give adequate medical treatment for Sengar's brother
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court Tuesday directed the jail authorities to give adequate medical treatment for oral cancer to expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar's brother Atul, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail for his role in the custodial killing of the Unnao rape victim's father.
Justice Vibhu Bakhru was informed that the convict, Atul Singh Sengar, has been diagnosed with oral cancer and requires extensive treatment.
The court was hearing Atul's plea seeking eight- week parole to get medical treatment for multiple health issues and has to undergo surgery in Kanpur.
In Tuesday's hearing, Atul's counsel told the court that subsequent to the earlier order, it has been discovered that he was suffering from oral cancer.
Keeping in view the Delhi government counsel's submission that jail authorities shall ensure adequate treatment is provided to the convict, Atul's lawyer did not press for the parole plea.
The court disposed of the plea ""with the direction that the jail authorities shall ensure necessary and adequate treatment, as advised by doctors, is provided to him (Atul).""
The CBI counsel had earlier submitted that considering his medical condition, he shall be granted custody parole as he is an influential person and shall not be released.
A trial court on March 13, had sentenced Sengar, Atul and five others to 10 years imprisonment for the death of Unnao rape victim's father in custody.
Sengar and his brother were also directed to pay Rs 10 lakh each as fine within three months to legal heirs of the man who died, including the rape victim, as compensation.
The father of the rape victim was arrested at the behest of Sengar in the Arms Act and had died in custody on April 9, 2018 owing police brutalities in custody.
The woman was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.
The trial, which started on August 5 last year after it was transferred from Unnao to Delhi on the Supreme Court's directions, was carried on a day-to-day basis.
Sengar was sentenced to life imprisonment by the trial court for the offence of raping the minor and he has challenged his conviction and punishment in the high court.

Brajesh Thakur, in the appeal, contended that the trial was conducted in a ""hurried manner"" (File)
New Delhi:
Brajesh Thakur, who was sentenced to life imprisonment till his last breath for sexually assaulting several girls in a shelter home in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district, has approached the Delhi High Court challenging his conviction and jail term.
The high court is likely to take up this week his appeal seeking to set aside trial court's January 20 judgment convicting him in the case and February 11 order sentencing him to life imprisonment till his last breath.
A trial court here had sentenced Thakur to ""rigorous imprisonment till remainder of his life"" and imposed a hefty fine of Rs 32.20 lakh on him, saying he was the ""kingpin"" of a ""meticulously planned"" conspiracy and ""displayed extreme perversity"".
Besides him, the trial court has also sent others to jail for life in the case.
Advocate Pramod Kumar Dubey, who represented Thakur before the trial court, confirmed that the appeal has been filed on his behalf.
Thakur, in the appeal, contended that the trial was conducted in a ""hurried manner"" by the special judge (POCSO), Saket, which was a flagrant violation of his right to a free and fair trial as guaranteed under the Constitution.
He claimed that his applications and submissions were dismissed in a mechanical manner without due application of judicial mind with a view to somehow conclude the trial.
The appeal, filed through advocates Nishaank Mattoo, Anurag Andley and Shreed Krsna, claimed that the conviction judgement and sentencing order were passed by the trial court in a prejudiced and mechanical manner having been swayed by the gruesomeness of the allegations levelled against Thakur and the public perception.
The appeal also raised the issue that potency of an accused is one of the foundational facts which the prosecution has to establish in a case related to rape and said neither the Bihar Police nor CBI had conducted the potency test of Thakur.
""The trial court has failed to appreciate that in a case relating to rape, the prosecution must first and foremost establish that an accused is potent and thereby capable of committing the alleged act...
""The trial court has failed to appreciate that there is no presumption under law that a person who is more than 50 years of age and admittedly suffering from high blood sugar has to be potent.... Without establishing the potency of the accused specially one who is more than 50 years of age the accused cannot be convicted of the offence of rape,"" it contended.
""The Special Judge, (POCSO), Saket while convicting the appellant (Thakur) has relied upon legally inadmissible evidence and has assumed the role of a prosecution witness by giving possible explanations which have neither been stated by the prosecution witnesses nor have been recorded in evidence and have further not even been argued by the prosecution during the course of final arguments,"" it alleged.
The appeal claimed that the trial court's verdict was ""illegal, incorrect, perverse and contrary to the evidence on record"" and hence liable to be set aside.
The trial court on January 20, had convicted Brajesh Thakur, who once unsuccessfully contested assembly polls on Bihar People's Party (BPP) ticket, of several offences including aggravated penetrative sexual assault under section 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and offences of rape and gang rape under the Indian Penal code (IPC).
Besides Brajesh Thakur, it had sentenced Dilip Verma, then Chairman of Child Welfare Committee; Child protection officer of District Child Protection Unit Ravi Roshan; member of Child Welfare Committee Vikas Kumar; Guddu Vijay; Kumar Tiwari; Guddu Patel; Kishan Kumar and Ramanuj Thakur to imprisonment for remainder of life in the case.
It had also send three women -- Minu Devi, Kiran Kumari and Shaista Praveen -- to jail for life for abetment to rape.
The trial court had sentenced Rama Shankar, Ashwani, Manju Devi, Chanda Devi, Neha Kumari and Hema Masih to 10 years in prison, and Indu Kumari to three years jail term.
It had imposed varying fines on the convicts.
It had also granted a compensation of Rs 5.50 lakh to three of the rape victims; Rs 6 lakh to one of the victims, Rs 9 lakh to another victim, Rs 40,000 each to two of the victims and Rs 25,000 to another victim.
Former Bihar Social Welfare Minister and the then JD(U) leader Manju Verma had also faced flak when allegations surfaced that her husband had links with Brajesh Thakur. She resigned from her post on August 8, 2018.
The case was transferred on February 7, 2019 from a local court in Muzaffarpur in Bihar to a POCSO court at Saket district court complex in Delhi on the Supreme Court's directions.
The matter had come to light on May 26, 2018 after Tata Institute of Social Sciences submitted a report to the Bihar government highlighting the alleged sexual abuse of girls in the shelter home for the first time.

During investigation, it came to notice that the accused was also missing.(Representational)
New Delhi:
A 20-year-old man was arrested from Punjab's Patiala and charged with kidnapping and rape, days after a minor girl went missing from her house in outer Delhi's Narela, police said on Wednesday.
They said the accused was arrested from the house of his relative in Patiala and the girl was also recovered from there.
The accused, a labourer, stays in the same locality in Narela where the 14-year-old girl lives with her family, they said.
After the girl went missing on June 14, her mother approached the police and a case was registered on her complaint under section 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code, police said.
During investigation, it came to notice that the accused was also missing from his home.
Technical surveillance was activated and the man was traced to Patiala, where he was staying at his relative''s place, said Gaurav Sharma, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Outer-North).
The missing girl was also traced to the same house, he said.
The girl also alleged sexual assault by the accused after which sections of rape under the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act were added in the case and the accused arrested, he added.
There was no clear assertion from the police or the two families if the two were in a relationship.
However, police said there was resentment in the girl's family as she was a minor and the man belonged to the other community.

Rape Survivors Need To Be Informed When Accused Get Bail: Delhi High Court

The court was hearing a case related to the bail granted to the accused in a girl's rape case. (File)
New Delhi:
Courts cannot ignore issuing notice to survivors in sexual assault cases while deciding bail pleas of offenders, the Delhi High Court has held, noting that survivors were not being informed in a majority of matters.
Hearing a case related to the bail granted to the accused in a girl's rape case, the court said that during emergency situations such as the current lockdown, bail pleas are being heard by sessions judges who are not regular POCSO courts, so it is necessary to sensitise them about these mandatory provisions.
The HC set aside the trial court' order granting interim bail to the accused in the girl's rape case without giving a hearing or notice to the girl.
""It is deemed appropriate to direct that any non-compliance of the mandatory condition of issuance of notice and service of notice to the complainant/ victim/informant could entail consequential action, in accordance with law,"" the court said.
It also directed respective district judges to conduct sensitisation programmes through videoconferencing within a week and inform all presiding officers about the importance of compliance of this mandatory condition.
Justice Prathiba M Singh said the petition challenging the interim bail granted to the accused without giving her notice has highlighted a ""perennial and grave problem"" -- hearing not being accorded to survivors in bail pleas filed by the accused facing trial for rape and gang-rape of children under the IPC and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
In pursuance to court's earlier direction, the registrar general of the high court collected data from the trial courts for the period between April 22 to May 23, which is the lockdown period. The data showed that out of 294 cases where bail was sought by the accused in sexual offences cases, notices were issued to the complainant in only 79 matters.
""...in 215 cases constituting almost 70 per cent, no notice was issued. A perusal of the report of the registrar general, in fact, confirms the analysis which has been placed on record by the petitioner in respect of 122 cases, to the effect that complainants/ informants are not being heard prior to hearing in bail applications to accused under the provisions of the POCSO Act,"" it said, adding that, issuance of notice is the mandate of law.
The court added there was also no doubt that most sessions courts are not issuing notices to the complainant before entertaining or hearing bail applications of accused, including those for interim bail.
In fact, even if compromise is the ground for seeking bail, there is a greater need that the same ought to be verified or confirmed from the complainant/survivor, it said.
The plea was filed by the girl's mother, through advocate Tara Narula, challenging the interim bail granted to the accused on May 5 on the ground that the order was passed in routine manner and was not only bad in law but also suffered from procedural lapse on the part of the sessions court.
The survivor's counsel submitted that with effect from April 21, 2018, there was an amendment in the law by which it has been mandated that the presence of the informant or any person authorised shall be obligatory at the time of hearing of the application for bail to the person accused of sexual offences.
The period for which the interim bail was granted to the accused expired on June 5, the day the high court passed its verdict. As the accused has filed a fresh bail application before the sessions court, the high court said it be decided in accordance with law after hearing the complainant and the prosecution and also the grounds raised by the man in the plea.
The court said non-issuance of notice to the complainants or survivors is not merely a procedural lapse, but is clearly contrary to the unequivocal legislative mandate and settled law.
It said the lockdown period has thrown up several challenges to the judicial system which courts are bracing for on an everyday basis and issuance of notice to the complainant is such a fundamental precondition, that the requirement of law cannot be bypassed, ignored or neglected.

Delhi High Court said it would be dangerous to release him in the current coronavirus pandemic situation.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has dismissed the plea filed by an accused in a rape case seeking interim bail to perform his father's last rites, saying it would be dangerous to release him in the current coronavirus pandemic situation as he will get in touch with many people outside increasing the risk of infection.
The court also said the bail application was totally silent on various aspects including record of recovery of the body of man's father who allegedly died by drowning, documents of cremation and details of other ceremonies.
""There is another aspect of this matter. The village of the petitioner (accused) is around 800 Km from Delhi so it will be highly dangerous to release the petitioner on interim bail as it is not known as to how many persons he will get in touch while he will be there in his village,"" Justice Rajnish Bhatnagar said.
The court added, ""There are great chances of his being infected and then his coming to jail after a period of interim bail would further complicate the matter which cannot be allowed in the current pandemic situation. Needless to repeat that the interim bail application is totally bereft of any details.""
Accused Rakesh Kumar claimed that his father died on April 9 by drowning in a river in Kurwa village in Uttar Pradesh Ambedkar Nagar and sought to be released on interim bail for two months to perform the last rites and to settle family affairs.
The man, against whom a rape case was registered against Kumar in 2014 at Anand Parbat police station, said he has been lodged in jail for over six years.
The prosecution opposed the bail plea saying nothing has been placed on record to show that the man's father died on April 9 due to drowning and contended that the allegations against him are serious in nature as he is accused of raping a minor girl.
The high court, while dismissing the bail plea, said ""Nothing has been placed on record to show that the father of the petitioner expired on April 9 by drowning. The petitioner could have filed the police documents regarding the recovery of the dead body of his father or any document to show that he was cremated.
""More so, in the entire bail application it is not stated as to what all ceremonies have to take place and on which date these ceremonies are to be performed. The bail application is totally silent on this aspect.""
The court, which was informed by the prosecutor that the trial court has fixed the matter for pronouncement of judgement, said it was expected from the lower court that the verdict would be passed as expeditiously as possible and when the situation warrants.

Nirbhaya Rape Convicts' Last-Minute Petition Against Hanging Dismissed

The convicts had filed another series of petitions in the Supreme Court, which also got dismissed
New Delhi:
The 5.30 am execution inching closer, three of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case had approached the Delhi High Court late this evening for a last minute reprieve, but drew a blank. The judges dismissed the petition, pointing out that there is ""No annexure, no memo of parties, there is nothing in this matter, no affidavits, nothing"".
Convicted in the horrific rape and murder of a 23-year-old medical student more than seven years ago, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Kumar Singh, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Singh have been taking turns to file a series of petitions after their first death warrant was issued on January 7. 
Akshay Kumar Singh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma moved to the higher court after the trial court in Delhi dismissed the petition of for a freeze on the execution early this afternoon. The court said they have exhausted all legal options.  All three had filed another series of petitions in the Supreme Court, which also got dismissed today.
At the High Court, the shortcomings of the petition drew the wrath of the judges, who called it a shoddy job. 
""Do you have the permission to file this petition?"" Justice Manmohan asked the advocate representing the convicts. 
Advocate AP Singh's response -- that making photocopies was not possible due to coronavirus - was scoffed at. ""See how open the courts are. You have done three courts today. You can't say things are not accessible. We are here at 10 pm listening to you,"" the judge responded, admonishing the lawyer to take the matter seriously.
Dismissing the petition, the judges said, ""Your contentions have been rejected by the Supreme Court. Can we set aside the Supreme Court's judgement? There will be chaos"".
The execution date of tomorrow was fixed after repeated cancellations as the convicts tried every legal avenue to buy time. Two days ago, three of the four convicts had filed petitions in the trial court asking for a freeze on the execution - which were dismissed. 
The four convicts - along with two others -- had gang-raped the young woman in a moving bus on the night of December 16, 2012. Tortured with an iron rod and thrown off the vehicle, she died on December 29 at a hospital in Singapore.
The main accused, Ram Singh, was found hanging in jail. The other, just a few months short of 18 when the crime was committed, was released after spending three years in a reform home.
The savage assault had stunned the nation and led to multiple changes in how the law treats juveniles involved in serious crimes like rape and murder.

All the four convicts of Nirbhaya are currently lodged in Tihar jail.
New Delhi:
Former judges of the Delhi High Court on Thursday backed the death penalty for the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case asserting that it was a rarest of the rare case and the ""brutality"" committed by them on December 16, 2012 deserved the extreme punishment.
While Justice (retd.) S.N. Dhingra stated that death penalty is justified to these four men saying that no mercy should be given to them (the four convicts - Akshay, Pawan, Mukesh and Vinay) who had no mercy in their hearts at the time of committing the heinous crime, Justice (retd.) R.S. Sodhi stated that those who don't value human rights of others, cannot expect mercy.
Speaking to IANS over the phone, Justice Dhingra said: ""Issue no mercy to the people who have no mercy in their hearts and minds. If you recall the crime, they (convicts) say that how they inserted a rod in her private parts and took out her intestines.
""They were not repentive then and even now they are not repentive and if you (convicts) are claiming that you were not there (crime spot) after the trial has concluded, it is of no use.""
He also asserted that in the manner in which the crime took place, there is ""no alternate punishment"" other than death penalty.
Justice Sodhi while backing capital punishment for the four men -- Akshay, Pawan, Vinay and Mukesh said: ""If you do not know how to value the human rights of anybody else then you cannot expect the act of mercy to fall upon you.""
""If at the same time you have brought brutality to your act and that too at a level that it shocked the conscious of every sane person and therefore if you have shaken the conscious of the country then you deserve to die,"" Justice Sodhi added.
The reactions from the former judges came in at a time when less than 24 hours remained in the hanging of the four death row convicts -- Akshay, Pawan, Mukesh and Vinay which is scheduled for March 20 at 5.30 a.m.
The case pertains to the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old girl, dubbed later as Nirbhaya, in the national capital in December 2012. Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused.
Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail days after the trial began in the case. The juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.

Nirbhaya Case: Punita Devi, the wife of convict Akshay Singh, was seen outside the Patiala House Court.
New Delhi:
Barely 24 hours before the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case are to be executed, a drama played out outside Delhi's Patiala House court today as the wife of one of the convicts threatened to kill herself. Akshay Singh and three others, found guilty of the horrific rape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedical student eight years ago, will be hanged tomorrow.
The convicts have used every ruse to delay the execution, taking it in turns to file repeated  petitions. Another plea was to be heard by the court today - filed by three of the convicts two days ago. 
Outside the court that was to hear the case, Punita Devi, the wife of Akshay Singh, was found sitting this morning, her child beside her. The woman appeared to have a nervous breakdown and fainted. After regaining consciousness, she started beating herself with a slipper, saying, ""I don't want to live. I will kill myself."" 
The woman has filed for divorce in a local court in Bihar, contending that she does not wish to be a widow of a man who was hanged.
In the divorce plea, she asserted that her husband was innocent. ""My husband is innocent. I want to be legally divorced before he is hanged,"" she said in her petition.
During today's hearing, the court was told that all four convicts have exhausted all legal options available to them. 
The four convicts, along with two others -- one of them a minor -- had gang-raped the young woman and tortured her with an iron rod on the night of December 16, 2012. After fighting for life for days, she died on December 29 at a hospital in Singapore.
One of the assailants, just short of 18 when the crime was committed, was released after spending three years at a reform home. The main accused, Ram Singh, was found hanging in jail.
The brutality of the attack had outraged the nation bringing thousands on the streets in protest, which led to key changes in the law and security system.

The judge sought a report from Tihar authorities, state government (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Wednesday came down heavily on the lawyer representing the death-row convicts in Nirbhaya rape case, asking him why he always approaches court at the last hour.
In another manoeuvre to delay the ensuing death sentence slated for Friday, the convicts, through their counsel AP Singh, once again knocked on the doors of the trial court seeking a stay on their hanging on the grounds that they still have pending legal remedies.
Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana, seeking a report from the Tihar Jail authorities and state government by 12am on Thursday, observed, ""Why do you approach court at last hour?""
Public Prosecutor Irfan Ahmed opposed the application on the grounds of its maintainibilty. ""There is no legal remedy pending. There are just 36 hours left for their hanging.""
Four convicts -- Vinay, Mukesh, Akshay, and Pawan are scheduled to be executed on March 20 at 5:30 am for brutally raping and murdering a 23-year-old physiotherapy student in Delhi on December 16, 2012.

Nirbhaya Convict Mukesh Singh (L) filed a plea claiming he was not in Delhi on the day of the crime
New Delhi:
A Delhi court today reserved its order on plea of Mukesh Singh, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, seeking quashing of his death penalty.
Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana will pronounce the order later today.
The plea claimed that Mukesh Singh was arrested from Rajasthan and brought to Delhi on December 17, 2012, and he was not present in the city on December 16, when the crime took place.
The public prosecutor told the court that Mukesh Singh's plea is frivolous and a tactic to delay the scheduled hanging.
The plea also alleged that Mukesh Singh was tortured inside the Tihar jail.
On March 5, a trial court issued fresh warrants with March 20, 5.30 am, as the date for the execution of convicts Mukesh Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31).

President Ram Nath Kovind has rejected the mercy petitions of all four convicts. (File)
New Delhi:
Three of the four men convicted in the 2012 gang-rape and killing of Nirbhaya today petitioned the United Nation's International Court of Justice (ICJ) in another eleventh-hour attempt to stall their hanging, scheduled on Friday.
Akshay Singh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma approached the World Court on a day the fourth convict, Mukesh Singh, was told by the Supreme Court that he had no legal remedy left after his mercy petition and curative plea were both rejected.
On December 16, 2012, the young woman who came to be known as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped on a moving bus and tortured, in a savage assault that led to her death days later and changed an entire nation forever.
Ram Singh, one of the six men arrested after the incident, allegedly committed suicide in Delhi's Tihar Jail. The youngest, who was just short of 18, was released after three years in a reform home.
After three previous dates of hanging came and went, the four men, Akshay Thakur, 31, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Mukesh Singh, 32, are expected to be hanged at 5.30 am on Friday. 
President Ram Nath Kovind has rejected the mercy petitions of all four convicts. Akshay Singh Thakur has filed another petition claiming that mercy plea rejected by the President did not have ""complete facts"".
This morning, as Mukesh Singh asked to file a new curative petition, the Supreme Court said: ""Circumstances say there is no remedy left. You (Mukesh Singh) have availed mercy plea. It was rejected. Warrants issued. Curative petition has been dismissed. What's the remedy left?"" 
The ICJ was last in the news over the dispute over Indian man Kulbhushan Jadhav's death sentence in Pakistan

Mukesh Singh was one of the four men convicted in the 2012 Delhi gang rape.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court on Monday rejected the request by one of convicts in the 2012 Delhi gang-rape to file a new curative petition against his death sentence, refusing to once again put on hold their execution due this week.
""Circumstances say there is no remedy left. You (Mukesh Singh) have availed mercy plea. It was rejected. Warrants issued. Curative petition has been dismissed. What's the remedy left?"" the Supreme Court said.
Mukesh Singh had sought the cancellation of all orders passed by courts and the rejection of his mercy petition by President Ram Nath Kovind since the day his curative petition was dismissed by the top court on the grounds that their lawyer Vrinda Grover had misled him.
The petion, filed through advocate M L Sharma, sought a CBI probe into a ""criminal conspiracy"" and ""fraud"" by the central government, the Delhi government and advocate Vrinda Grover, who is the amicus curiae in the case.
The four convicts, who were served death penalty for the gangrape and murder of a 23-year-old medical student in Delhi - dubbed Nirbhaya - more than seven years ago, are expected to be hanged on Friday, at 5:30 am.
The death warrant, the fourth one, was issued a day after President Ram Nath Kovind rejected the mercy petition of Pawan Gupta, the last of the four death row convicts. With the President's rejection, the convicts had exhausted all options for relief from the death sentence.
Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana fixed March 20 as the new date of execution after it was told by the Delhi government that the convicts have exhausted all their legal remedies. The lawyer for the four death row convicts also told the court that there was no legal impediment for court in proceeding to fix the date of execution.
Akshay Thakur, 31, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Mukesh Singh, 32, had filed multiple staggered petitions challenging their death sentence.
The four convicts, along with two others - one of them a minor - had gang-raped the young woman and tortured her with an iron rod on the night of December 16, 2012. She died on December 29 at a hospital in Singapore.
One of the attackers, just short of 18 when the crime was committed, was released after spending three years at a reform home. The main accused, Ram Singh, was found hanging in jail.
The brutality of the attack had outraged the nation bringing thousands on the streets in protest, which led to key changes in the law and security system.

Nirbhaya Convict Vinay Sharma Moves High Court Over Rejected Mercy Plea

Vinay Sharma's lawyer said the matter has been filed in high court registry.
New Delhi:
One of the four death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, Vinay Sharma, on Friday approached the Delhi High Court claiming that there were procedural lapses and ""constitutional irregularities"" in the rejection of his mercy plea by President Ram Nath Kovind.
The petition on Sharma's behalf was moved by his lawyer A P Singh who said the matter has been filed in the high court registry.
The plea claims that the recommendation sent to the President to reject the mercy plea did not contain the signature of Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain.
Vinay's mercy plea was rejected by the President on February 1.
According to the petition, when the issue was raised before the Supreme Court, the Centre had contended that Mr Jain's signature was obtained on Whatsapp.
It further claims that when the mercy plea was moved the model code of conduct (MCC) was in force and Jain was only a MLA candidate at that point of time as polls had been announced and therefore, he could not have exercised the power of Home Minister.
""To reject the mercy petition, the powers used are illegal, unconstitutional, a miscarriage of justice and also miscarriage of constitutional values of Election Commission of India,"" the petition has alleged.
The plea seeks an ""order of direction in the nature of a certiorari in connection with the Constitutional irregularities that occurred during the MCC in National Capital Territory of Delhi by the respondents/concerned responsible persons. Please (take) appropriate legal cognisance on the petitioner's petition as soon as possible, because the motto of our Constitution is access to justice for all"".
A Delhi court on March 5 issued death warrants for execution of the four convicts -- Vinay (26), Akshay Kumar Singh (31), Mukesh Kumar Singh (32) and Pawan Kumar Gupta (26) -- on March 20.
Nirbhaya is the name given to the 23-year-old physiotherapy intern who was raped and brutally assaulted in a moving bus in Delhi by six people in December 2012.
She had boarded the nearly vacant bus in Munirka in South Delhi along with her male friend on her way back home on December 16 that year. After raping and brutalising the woman and beating her friend, the assailants had thrown them out of the bus.
After receiving initial treatment in New Delhi for a few days, she was shifted to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, where she succumbed to injuries on December 29, 2012.

Supreme Court To Examine If Convicts In Same Case Can Be Hanged Separately
The execution of death warrants of these convicts has been deferred thrice so far due to delays by them in exhausting their legal remedies.

Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court Thursday said it would examine the legal issue arising out of the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case on whether there could be separate hanging in a case where there are more than one death row convicts.
""The question is whether there can be separate hanging or whether it has to be simultaneous. We will go into it,"" said a three-judge bench headed by Justice R Banumathi.
The apex court said this while hearing an appeal filed by the Centre and the Delhi government challenging the February 5 order of Delhi High Court which had said that the four Nirbhaya case convicts have to be executed simultaneously.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for Centre and Delhi government, told the bench that these convicts have taken the justice delivery system for ""a ride"" and made a ""mockery"" of it by adopting delay tactics.
The execution of death warrants of these convicts has been deferred thrice so far due to delays by them in exhausting their legal remedies.
Tushar Mehta, who said ""credibility of the system is at stake"", informed the bench that a trial court has fixed March 20 as the date of execution of the four convicts who have exhausted all their legal remedies.
The bench, also comprising justices Ashok Bhushan and A S Bopanna posted the plea for arguments on merits on March 23 and made it clear that no adjournment would be given.
About 30-minutes before proceedings commenced in the top court, a trial court here issued fresh warrants with March 20, 5.30 am, as the date for the execution of the convicts -- Mukesh Kumar Singh, 32, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Akshay Kumar Singh, 31.
During the arguments, Tushar Mehta said there was no statutory provision that stipulates that convicts have to be executed simultaneously and as per the law, the only trial of a case has to be conducted simultaneously.
""Today, there are four convicts in this case. Tomorrow, there may be a case having 10 or 20 such convicts and they may again delay the execution by moving separate forums at different times,"" he said, referring to the tactics adopted by the convicts in the Nirbhaya case.
Tushar Mehta said pleas filed by Mukesh and Vinay against the rejection of their mercy petitions by President has already been dismissed by the apex court.
""For Mukesh and Vinay, we should be permitted to execute them. There is no need to give any further time to them,"" he said, adding, ""This is not our anxiety to hang somebody. Nobody likes this. Our anxiety is that the credibility of the system is at stake"".
He said the two other convicts -- Akshay and Pawan -- will now file pleas in the top court challenging rejection of their mercy petitions and in this case, the authorities should be allowed to execute Mukesh and Vinay.
""It is de-humanising to keep them under such threat,"" Tushar Mehta said while referring to the fact that Mukesh and Vinay have already exhausted all their remedies.
When the bench said it would hear the matter on merits on March 23, Tushar Mehta said, ""These convicts have taken the system for a ride. Please say that whosoever of them want to file for whatsoever remedy, they should do it before March 20"".
To this, the bench said, ""We will not say this. We will hear the matter on March 23"".
At the outset, advocate M L Sharma, representing Mukesh, said he wanted to file a counter affidavit in the form of an application and raise some crucial issues related to the case of Mukesh.
""It (application) is frivolous and vexatious. Mr Sharma says that Mukesh was being represented by lawyer Vrinda Grover and she had not done her job in collusion with the state. I must say that Vrinda Grover has done her best in the case,"" Tushar Mehta told the bench.
Hearing Tushar Mehta's submission, Justice Banumathi said, ""Mr Sharma, clients will come and go but your brother and sister colleagues will always be here. You cannot file a counter-cum-application. You can file counter affidavit only"".
""It is uncharitable to make such remarks,"" the bench said.
During the arguments, Tushar Mehta said that the high court had on February 5 given one week to the convicts to exhaust all their remedies but the trial court kept on extending the date of execution without any jurisdiction.
""Once the high court said one week, the time can be extended by the high court or the Supreme Court. The trial court has no jurisdiction to extend the time,"" he said, adding that it was ""disturbing"".
Justice Ashok Bhushan said that the trial court had to extend the date of execution as mercy petition of convicts were pending with the President at that time.
Advocate A P Singh, appearing for Vinay and Akshay, said that Tihar jail is totally silent about pending mercy plea of Akshay as the petition which was rejected by the President was ""incomplete"".
""Do not make a mockery of the system,"" Tushar Mehta told Singh.
At the fag end of the hearing, Sharma claimed that Mukesh was ""compelled"" to file his curative petition in the top court despite the fact that there is no limitation on filing it.
The bench told Sharma that all curative petitions have already been rejected in the case.
A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ''Nirbhaya'' (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted in a moving bus in South Delhi on December 16, 2012. She had died after a fortnight.
Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused. Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail days after the trial began in the case.
The juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.

Delhi High Court declined to entertain a plea seeking check-up of Nirbhaya convicts' health.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court Wednesday declined to entertain a plea seeking directions to the NHRC to intervene and enquire into the mental and physical state of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.
A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar said the petition was not maintainable as it should have been first filed in the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).
Asking the petitioner to move the NHRC, the bench disposed of his plea.
The petitioner, advocate A Rajarajan, had claimed that the four convicts -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Kumar Gupta (25), Vinay Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar Singh (31) -- have been kept in solitary confinement under fear of death ""on the whims and fancies"" of the authorities and it can affect their mental stability.
The petition had also referred to the allegations that the four were facing physical abuse in the prison.
It had also claimed that the authorities acted contrary to law by not initiating process to execute death sentence of the four convicts after the expiry of 30 days from the dismissal of their appeals by the Supreme Court in May 2017.
On January 7, death warrants were issued for the first time in the case to execute the four on January 22.
However, on January 17, the trial court changed the date of execution to February 1 after one of them -- Mukesh -- moved a mercy plea before the President.
Subsequently, on January 31, the trial court put on hold the execution after two more -- Akshay and Vinay -- moved mercy pleas.
Thereafter, on February 17, the trial court set March 3 as the date of execution of the four.
On March 2, the executions were put on hold for the third time as Pawan had moved a mercy plea, which was rejected on Wednesday.
A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ''Nirbhaya'' (fearless), was gang-raped and assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi.
She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

""Tareekh Pe Tareekh"": Rishi Kapoor On Delay In Nirbhaya Convicts' Hanging

Rishi Kapoor finds the delay ridiculous, and he took to twitter to express his view with a post.
Mumbai:
Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor used the popular ""Tareekh pe tareekh"" dialogue from the 1993 film ""Damini"" to slam the Delhi Court judgment to defer the execution of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya rape and murder case.
On Monday, a court in Delhi again deferred the execution of the four convicts in the Nirbhaya rape and murder case, which was slated for Tuesday, till further orders.
Mr Kapoor finds the delay ridiculous, and he took to twitter to express his view with a post.
""Nirbhaya case. Tareekh pe tareekh, tareekh pe tareekh, tareekh pe tareekh - 'Damini'. Ridiculous,"" he tweeted. It may be recalled, ""Damini"" starring Rishin Kapoor and Sunny Deol with Meenakshi Sheshadri in the title role, was a courtroom drama that is fought out in the aftermath of the rape of a young domestic help by a group of influential boys.
Sunny Deol, who fights the case to ensure justice for the dead victim, mouths the ""Tareek pe tareek"" dialogue in frustration and anger even as the defence manages to bank on one loophole after the other to keep deferring the verdict.
In the Nirbhaya case, the four convicts -- Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Kumar Sharma and Akshay Kumar -- were scheduled to be hanged at 6 am on March 3.
Pawan Gupta, the last of the four convicts to seek legal remedy or file a mercy petition, had moved a fresh application seeking a stay on the hanging, as his mercy plea is pending before the President after the court dismissed their application seeking stay on hanging earlier on Monday.
He filed the mercy petition after his curative petition was rejected by Supreme Court on Monday morning.
The case pertains to the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old girl, christened Nirbhaya by the media, in the Capital in December 2012. Six people, including the four convicts and a juvenile, were named as accused.
Ram Singh, the sixth accused, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail days after the trial began in the case. The juvenile was released in 2015 after spending three years in a correctional home.

Nirbhaya case: The convicts were scheduled to be hanged today at 6am
New Delhi:
The four men convicted in the rape and killing of a 23-year-old medical student in Delhi in 2012 will not be hanged today as scheduled, a judge in Delhi said on Monday, deferring their execution for the third time.
The mercy petition of one of the convicts, Pawan Gupta, is pending with President Ram Nath Kovind, so they have not exhausted all their legal options, the judge ruled.
""The condemned convict must not meet his creator with a grievance in his bosom that the courts of this country have not acted fairly in granting him an opportunity to exhaust his legal remedies,"" said the Patiala House court in Delhi.
For weeks, Akshay Thakur, 31, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Sharma, 26, and Mukesh Singh, 32, have been filing staggered petitions challenging their death sentence in an effort to stall the execution.
The four men and two others, including one just short of 18, were arrested after the 2012 gang rape of a young woman on a moving bus. One of the main accused, Ram Singh, was found hanging in his jail cell in 2013. The teen was released after three years in a reform home.
On December 16, 2012, the medical student, who came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"", was on her way back from a movie with a friend when she was lured onto a bus. She was assaulted and tortured so brutally that she died days later, triggering an unprecedented outpouring of public anger over crimes against women.
""She was savagely raped and thrown on the streets. Her intestines were ripped out. And all these courts are sitting and watching a tamasha,"" Nirbhaya's distraught mother said outside the court.
Seema Kushwaha, the prosecution lawyer said, ""Can't the court understand the manipulation of law? Our system is completely rotten. It takes years to get justice. We have to fix it together.""
Last month, the central government approached the Supreme Court for a change in laws that it said were skewed in favour of criminals.
As the convicts filed petition after petition, timing them carefully to buy some reprieve, Pawan Gupta apparently waited till the end to make his move.
After his curative petition was rejected by the Supreme Court this morning, he filed a mercy petition before the President and went back to the Delhi court asking for his execution to be put off.
""You are playing with fire, you should be cautious,"" said the judge to Pawan's lawyer.
The hanging had been deferred twice before, on January 22 and February 1. On February 5, the Delhi High Court ordered that all four would have a week to exhaust all their legal remedies, including mercy petitions to the President, and said they cannot be hanged separately.

On December 20, Kuldeep Singh Sengar was sentenced to life in jail for raping the woman in 2017 (File)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Saturday deferred to next week its judgment in the murder case of the father of the woman who was raped by expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao three years ago.
The rape survivor's had father died on April 9, 2018, in judicial custody.
District judge Dharmesh Sharma deferred the judgment, which will now be pronounced on Wednesday.
The Central Bureau of Investigation had examined 55 witnesses in support of the case and the defence examined nine witnesses. The court had recorded the statements of the rape survivor's uncle, mother, sister and one of her father's colleague who claimed to be an eyewitness to the incident.
The court had on December 20 sent Sengar to jail for ""remainder of his natural biological life"" for raping the woman in 2017 when she was a minor.
According to the CBI, on April 3, 2018, there was an altercation between the survivor's father and Shashi Pratap Singh.
The chargesheet filed on July 13, 2018, said the survivor's father and his co-worker were returning to their village, Makhi, when they asked Singh for lift.
Singh denied them the lift, triggering an altercation among them. Singh called his associates, following which MLA's brother Atul Singh Sengar reached the spot along with others and beat up the survivor's father and his co-worker.
The survivor's father was subsequently taken to the police station by them and an FIR was lodged against him. He was arrested.
The charge sheet said that all this while Kuldeep Sengar was in touch with the district police superintendent and Makhi police station incharge Ashok Singh Bhadauria. Later he also talked to the doctor who examined the survivor's father.
The court had earlier framed charges against Sengar, his brother Atul, Bhadauria, sub-inspector Kamta Prasad, constable Amir Khan and six others in the case.
The case was transferred to Delhi from a trial court in Uttar Pradesh on the directions of the Supreme Court on August 1.
In July, a truck rammed into the car the rape survivor was travelling in with some family members and her lawyer. Two of her aunts died in the incident.
She was airlifted from a hospital in Lucknow and brought to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi for better care as she continued to be critical. She has been given accommodation in Delhi and is under Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) protection.

Vinay Sharma's lawyer had earlier also claimed that he was assaulted in jail.
New Delhi:
A Delhi court today dismissed a petition by Vinay Sharma, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, seeking treatment for ""mental illness"".
Additional Sessions Judge Dharmender Rana rejected the plea after Tihar Jail authorities submitted a report stating that Shamra doesn't suffer from any psychological disorders.
The judge said, ""General anxiety and depression in case of a death row convict is obvious. In the case at hand, evidently, adequate medical treatment and psychological help have been provided to the condemned convict.""
""I do not have any plausible reasons to disbelieve them"".
""I have also seen the CD provided by the jail authorities wherein the convict is seen conversing with his counsel and family members. The apparent tone and tenor of the convict is not suggestive of any abnormal behaviour, rather it convincingly corroborates the opinion of the medical experts.""
The plea filed on behalf of Vinay Sharma claimed that he is suffering from ""insanity"", ""mental illness"" and ""schizophrenia"". It also said he fractured his arm and grievously injured his head. 
Terming his claims as a ""bundle of distorted fats"", the jail authorities told the court that CCTV footage established Vinay Sharma had inflicted ""superficial"" injuries on himself.
The psychologist who has been examining all the four convicts on a daily basis inside the jail has said none of them suffer from any mental illness.
Vinay Sharma's lawyer had earlier also claimed that he was assaulted in jail and that he was suffering from acute mental illness, so the death sentence cannot be carried out.
Six men, including one just short of 18, were arrested after the December 16, 2012 gangrape. One of the main accused, Ram Singh, was found hanging in his jail cell. The teen was released after three years in a reform home.

The Supreme Court is hearing some pleas pertaining to the Nirbhaya rape and murder case.
New Delhi:
A Supreme Court judge fainted in the courtroom on Friday while she was dictating an order on the centre's petition seeking separate executions for the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, news agency PTI reported.
Justice R Banumathi regained consciousness even as court staffers rushed to her aid, PTI said, adding that she was subsequently taken to her chamber in a wheelchair. The three-judge bench, also comprising Justices AS Bopanna and Ashok Bhushan, said that the order will be passed in-chamber.
In a related development, the same bench dismissed the plea of Vinay Sharma -- one of the four death row convicts in the case -- challenging the rejection of his mercy petition by President Ram Nath Kovind. ""We do not find any ground for exercise of judicial review of the order of the President of India rejecting the petitioner's mercy petition and this writ petition is liable to be dismissed,"" it said.
Vinay Sharma had claimed in the Supreme Court that President Ram Nath Kovind did not consider the ""mental stability"" he suffered due to torture in jail while rejecting his mercy petition. The centre denied the assertion, saying he was ""fit and of sound mind"". This was part of the convict's last-ditch effort to escape the death sentence handed to him and three others for the brutal sexual assault on a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern on December 16, 2012.
The top court had earlier rejected the request of AP Singh, the counsel of Vinay Sharma, seeking the perusal of the original file of recommendation made by Delhi Home Minister Satyendra Jain and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal for the rejection of his mercy petition. Mr Singh says their signatures had not been obtained for the same, a claim rejected by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.
Vinay Sharma's counsel claimed that all ""relevant materials"" pertaining to his client had not been placed before the President, who rejected the mercy petition within 48 hours. Mr Singh argued that the history of physical assaults on Vinay Sharma and his medical records establishes the fact that he was taken for psychiatric treatment on several occasions.
Tushar Mehta countered this by saying that Vinay Sharma's case falls in the ""rarest of rare category"" deserving of death sentence, and cited prison records to claim that he was not kept in solitary confinement. The Supreme Court had earlier dismissed a plea filed by Mukesh Kumar Singh, another death row convict in the case, challenging the rejection of his mercy petition by the President.

Vinay Sharma has sought clemency on the grounds that he suffers from ""mental illness"".
New Delhi:
A death row convict in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case today claimed in the Supreme Court that the President had not considered the ""mental stability"" he suffered due to torture in jail while rejecting his mercy petition. The centre denied the assertion, saying he was ""fit and of sound mind"".
This was part of Vinay Sharma's last-ditch effort to escape the death sentence handed to him and three other convicts for the brutal sexual assault on a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern on December 16, 2012. In his submission, the convict said that all the relevant records -- including one pertaining to his mental illness -- had not been tabled before the President. The centre, however, produced a medical report dated February 12 which showed that he was not suffering from any mental illness.
A bench of Justices R Banumathi, Ashok Bhushan and AS Bopanna reserved its order on Vinay Sharma's plea challenging the rejection of his mercy petition by the President, saying that it will pronounce the verdict at 2 pm on Friday.
The top court also rejected the request of AP Singh, the counsel of Vinay Sharma, seeking the perusal of the original file of recommendation made by Delhi Home Minister Satyendra Jain and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal for the rejection of his mercy petition. Mr Singh says their signatures had not been obtained for the same, a claim rejected by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta.
Vinay Sharma's counsel also claimed that all ""relevant materials"" pertaining to his client had not been placed before the President, who rejected the mercy petition within 48 hours. Mr Singh argued that the history of physical assaults on Vinay Sharma and his medical records establishes the fact that he was taken for psychiatric treatment on several occasions.
Tushar Mehta countered this by saying that Vinay Sharma's case falls in the ""rarest of rare category"" deserving of death sentence, and cited prison records to claim that he was not kept in solitary confinement. The Supreme Court had earlier dismissed a plea filed by Mukesh Kumar Singh, another death row convict in the case, challenging the rejection of his mercy petition by the President.
A trial court had stayed ""until further orders"" the execution of four convicts -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) -- on January 31.
While Akshay Kumar's mercy plea has also been rejected, Pawan Gupta is yet to file his. The latter also has the option of putting in a curative petition, the last and final legal remedy available to a death row convict.
While a fifth convict committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar Jail days after the trial in the case first began, a juvenile offender was released after serving time in a correctional home for three years.

Delhi High Court has issued a warning to Twitter for not filing a response in the Hyderabad rape case.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has warned Twitter that it can face costs of Rs 10 lakh if it does not file its response to a petition that seeks action against media houses and social media platforms for revealing the identity of the Hyderabad rape victim.
""File an affidavit stating that you (Twitter) will not repeat it. What are you waiting for? If you are not filing the affidavit, we will impose costs,"" a bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar said to the social media platform.
The bench said that the High Court had earlier in a similar matter imposed costs of Rs 10 lakh on media houses for revealing identity of a minor rape victim.
""We do not want to repeat that order,"" the court said.
It gave Twitter four weeks time to file its affidavit and listed the matter for further hearing on May 4.
The court was hearing a PIL by lawyer Yashdeep Chahal seeking action against certain media houses and social media platforms like Twitter, where some individuals had revealed the identity of the Hyderabad rape victim.
Section 228A of the Indian Penal Code makes disclosure of identity of victim of certain offences, including rape, punishable with imprisonment of a term that may extend to two years and a fine.
The petition has claimed blatant violation of Section 228A by individuals, media houses and social media platforms by publishing elaborate reports revealing the identity of the victim and the four accused in the Hyderabad rape case on various online and offline portals.
A 26-year-old woman was allegedly raped and killed in Shamshabad, Telangana, by four men on the night of November 27.

A Delhi court Wednesday offered counsel to Pawan Gupta, one of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, saying a condemned convict is entitled to legal aide till his last breath.
Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana expressed displeasure over delay from convict Pawan Gupta's end who said he has removed his earlier lawyer and will need time to engage a new one.
District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) provided Pawan's father with a list of its empanelled advocates to choose from.
Pawan has not yet filed a curative petition - the last and final legal remedy available to a person which is decided in-chamber. He also has the option of filing a mercy plea.
Nirbhaya's parents and the Delhi government had moved the court on Tuesday seeking fresh death warrants for the four convicts after the Supreme Court granted liberty to the authorities to approach the trial court for issuance of fresh date for the execution of the convicts.
The date of execution, first fixed for January 22 in Tihar Jail, was postponed for 6 am on February 1 by a January 17 court order. The trial court later, on January 31 stayed, ""till further orders"" the execution of the four convicts in the case, who are lodged in Tihar Jail.
The Tihar jail authorities had filed a status report on Tuesday before the trial court stating that no legal option was preferred by any convicts - Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31) - in the last seven-day period, granted by the Delhi High Court.
The trial court had on February 7 dismissed the pleas of Delhi government and the Tihar jail authorities seeking fresh date for execution of the four death row convicts in the case.
They had taken note of the high court's February 5 order permitting the convicts to exercise their legal remedies within one week.
""It is criminally sinful to execute the convicts when law permits them to live. The high court on February 5 has permitted the convicts, in the interest of justice, to exercise their legal remedies within one week from same order,"" the court had said.
""I concur with counsel for convicts that death warrants cannot be executed merely on basis of surmises and conjectures. The application is bereft of merit. Same is dismissed. State is at liberty to move appropriate application as and when required,"" the judge had said.
In its order, the high court was critical of the delay caused by the authorities in seeking issuance of death warrants for the convicts as also of the ""delay tactics"" adopted by the convicts.
""All the authorities concerned were sleeping"" and waited till December 2019 ""for reasons best known to them"" to seek issuance of death warrants, the high court said.
The Delhi government moved the trial court for issuance of black warrants two years after the Supreme Court in 2017 had dismissed the review petition against the confirmation of death penalty.
The authorities had also informed the court about the Delhi High Court's February 5 order which directed the convicts to take steps within a week, if they wished, to avail any remedy available under the law.
The warrants, issued by the trial court on January 7, were later postponed ""sine die"" by it on January 31, giving the condemned prisoners a reprieve for the second time in two weeks.
The date of execution, first fixed for January 22 in Tihar jail, was later postponed for 6 am on February 1 by a January 17 court order.

Vinay Sharma has also asked the top court to reduce his punishment to life imprisonment.
New Delhi:
One of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya case challenged the rejection of his mercy petition by President Ram Nath Kovind in the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Vinay Sharma's counsel, AP Singh, also sought the reduction of his punishment from death sentence to life imprisonment.
Vinay Sharma and three other accused -- Mukesh Kumar Singh, Pawan Gupta and Akshay Kumar - have been found guilty of brutally raping and murdering a 23-year-old paramedical student in Delhi on December 16, 2012.
President Ram Nath Kovind had rejected Vinay Sharma's plea for clemency on February 1. A day earlier, a trial court had stayed ""until further orders"" the execution of all the four convicts in the case.
Pawan Gupta is yet to file a curative petition, the last and final legal remedy available to a person sentenced to death. He also has the option of filing a mercy petition.
Although six people were originally found guilty, one of them -- a juvenile -- was let off after being made to serve in a correctional home for three years. The prime accused, Ram Singh, committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar Jail days after the trial began.
The remaining four convicts were sentenced to death in September 2013 by the trial court.
Meanwhile, the parents of the rape victim have moved a Delhi court to seek the issuance of a fresh death warrant against the convicts, news agency PTI reported. They claimed that the convicts were making a ""mockery of the law"".
After hearing the plea, Additional Session Judge Dharmender Rana issued a notice to all the convicts and said it will take up the matter on Wednesday.
Mukesh Kumar Singh had earlier challenged the rejection of his mercy plea before the Supreme Court. His petition was rejected.

Nirbhaya case: The convicts' hanging was postponed indefinitely by the trial court.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday the central and the Delhi government's request for separate hanging of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.
The government had challenged the Delhi High Court verdict dismissing its plea against the stay on the execution of the four men.
The government had wanted notices to be sent to the four convicts. A bench headed by Justice R Bhanumathi did not heed to the government's request, saying it would further delay the matter.
""The nation's patience has been tested enough, the Supreme Court will have to lay down law on this, the government's lawyer Tushar Mehta said.
Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta, Mukesh Singh and Akshay Singh - convicted for the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedical student, who came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" in Delhi in 2012 - were to be executed on February 1 at Tihar Jail.
But a trial court in Delhi postponed the execution indefinitely after a second convict, Vinay Sharma, filed a mercy petition before President Ram Nath Kovind. As his appeal was turned down, another convict, Akshay Singh, filed his mercy plea.
The centre contends that the convicts were working in tandem, using every possible loophole to delay the execution.
The Delhi High Court on Wednesday gave the four convicts a week's time to finish exploring all legal options, after which the trial court will begin proceedings for their execution.
Apart from the four convicted men, two more were accused in the case. Ram Singh was found hanging in his cell and the sixth, who was just short of 18 when the crime was committed, was released after three years in a reform home.

The date of execution, first fixed for January 22 in Tihar jail, was later postponed.
New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Thursday sought the response of four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case on the petition of Tihar jail authorities seeking issuance of fresh death warrants against them. The response has to be submitted by Friday. 
Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana directed the convicts to file their response by Friday on the application moved by Tihar Jail authorities.
The trial court had on January 31 stayed ""till further orders"" execution of the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.
In its application, the states said the President has already dismissed the mercy petitions of three convicts and that no application by any of the four is currently pending before any court.
Pawan has not yet filed a curative petition -- the last and final legal remedy available to a person which is decided in-chamber. Pawan also has the option of filing a mercy plea.
The authorities also informed the court about Delhi High Court''s February 5 order which directed the convicts to take steps within a week, if they wished, to avail any remedy available under the law.
""It is, therefore, most respectfully prayed that, keeping in view a week''s time given to the convicts by high court, the fresh dates for execution of death warrants...may kindly be fixed specifying the date and time for execution/ hanging of convicts Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma, Mukesh and Akshay in the interest of justice,"" the application said.
The warrants, issued by the trial court on January 7, was later postponed ""sine die"" by it on January 31, giving the condemned prisoners a reprieve for the second time in two weeks.
The date of execution, first fixed for January 22 in Tihar jail, was later postponed for 6 am on February 1 by a January 17 court order.
The 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who came to be known as ''Nirbhaya'' (fearless), was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on the night of December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in South Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.
Six people including the four convicts, Ram Singh and a juvenile -- were named as accused.
The trial of the five adult men began in a special fast-track court in March 2013.
Ram Singh, the prime accused, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in Tihar jail days after the trial began. The juvenile, who was said to be the most brutal of the attackers, was put in a correctional home for three years.
The juvenile was released in 2015 and sent to an undisclosed location amid concerns over a threat to his life. He, when released, was 20 years old.
Mukesh, Vinay, Akshay and Pawan were sentenced to death in September 2013 by the trial court.

Delhi Court Allows Teen Rape Survivor To Terminate 24-Week Pregnancy
The medical opinion of the hospital was placed before Justice Vibhu Bakhru, who discussed it in-chamber with the 16-year-old girl and her parents before delivering the order in the open court.

The plea had said the rape survivor was examined by doctors at a government hospital.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Thursday allowed termination of 24-week pregnancy of a minor rape survivor after a medical board set up by the Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital said there was a significant risk to the teenager in continuing with it.
The medical opinion of the hospital was placed before Justice Vibhu Bakhru, who discussed it in-chamber with the 16-year-old girl and her parents before delivering the order in the open court.
The judge told the doctor from RML, who was present in court, to ensure the procedure is carried out within 24 hours.
The doctor told the court that risk associated with the procedure, including surgery, has been explained to the survivor and it can be carried out within a few hours of receiving the order.
Taking note of the statement, the court said the ""procedure be carried out as expeditiously as possible"" and to ""preserve the DNA"" for use as evidence.
With the directions the court disposed of the petition filed on behalf of the girl through advocates Anwesh Madhukar and Prachi Nirwan.
The court on February 4 had ordered RML to set up a medical board to examine the condition of the 6-year-old girl and submit a report on whether continuing the pregnancy will pose any risk to her health.
The petition was filed as Section 3 of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act does not permit termination of pregnancy in case the period of gestation is more than 20 weeks.
The petition had said that the pregnancy poses a substantial risk to the girl as she herself is of tender age.
The plea had said the rape survivor was examined by doctors at a government hospital in Delhi on January 25 and she was found to be 24 weeks pregnant.
A case of rape and criminal intimidation was then filed.
The doctor has opined that since the period of gestation is more than 20 weeks, it is beyond the permissible limit and court's permission is required for pregnancy termination.
The Union Cabinet had last week approved extending the upper limit for permitting abortions from the present 20 weeks to 24 weeks for ""special categories of women"" which would include rape survivors, victims of incest, differently-abled and minors, an official statement said.
The Cabinet has given its nod to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill, 2020 to amend the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971.

Hours after the High Court's verdict, the Centre filed an appeal against it in the Supreme Court.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear on Friday the Centre's appeal challenging the Delhi High Court's verdict dismissing its plea against stay on the execution of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.
Additional Solicitor General KM Natraj, appearing for the Centre, on Thursday mentioned the matter for urgent listing before a bench comprising Justices NV Ramana, Sanjiv Khanna and Krishna Murari.
Mr Natraj told the court that jail authorities are unable to execute the convicts in the case despite the fact that their review petitions have been dismissed and curative petitions and mercy pleas of three of them have been rejected.
The Delhi High Court Wednesday held that all the four convicts are to be executed together and not separately while setting a week's deadline for them to avail the remaining remedies.
If the convicts choose not to make any type of petition in seven days from now, the institutions/ authorities concerned will deal with the matter, as per the law, without further delay, it said.
Hours after the High Court's verdict, the Centre filed an appeal against it in the top court.
The High Court said all the four convicts in the Nirbhaya case have to be executed together, not separately, and faulted the authorities concerned for not taking steps for issuance of death warrants after rejection of appeals of the convicts by the Supreme Court in 2017.
The trial court had on January 31 stayed ""till further orders"" execution of the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.
A lawyer associated with the matter had said the grounds taken for challenge in the top court are almost the same as taken in the high court while filing the appeal against the trial court order.
He had said the Centre has stated in the petition in the apex court that the convicts can be hanged separately as Mukesh has exhausted all his remedies, including the mercy plea.

All 4 convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case to be executed together, the high court said
New Delhi:
All the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case are to be executed together and not separately, the Delhi High Court held on Wednesday while setting a week's deadline for them to avail of the remaining remedies.
If the convicts choose not to make any type of petition in seven days from now, the institutions / authorities concerned will deal with the matter, as per the law, without further delay, it said.
Justice Suresh Kumar Kait refused to accept the Centre's contention to set aside a trial court's January 31 order relating to the common execution of death warrants of the convicts.
The Centre and the Delhi government had challenged the trial court's January 31 order staying ""till further orders"" the execution of all the four convicts in the case - Mukesh Kumar Singh (32), Pawan Gupta (25), Vinay Kumar Sharma (26) and Akshay Kumar (31), who are lodged in Tihar Jail.
""Since up to the Supreme Court, their fate has been decided by a common order and judgment, therefore, in view of the facts of..., I am of the considered view that death warrants of all the convicts be executed together but not separately,"" the judge said.
The high court was critical of the delay caused by the authorities in executing death warrants and the delay tactics adopted by the convicts to frustrate the warrants.
""I have no hesitation to say that after dismissal of criminal appeals on May 5, 2017 by the Supreme Court, nobody had bothered to execute the death warrants. They waited for the reasons best know to them, till Mukesh filed review petition before the Supreme Court on November 6, 2017 after 186 days and the same was dismissed on July 9, 2018,"" the judge said.
The court noted that Vinay and Pawan filed review petitions on December 15, 2017 which were dismissed on July 9, 2018.
""Even thereafter, all authorities concerned were sleeping and waited till Akshay filed petition, with 950 days delay, on December 10, 2019 and the same was dismissed on December 18, 2019. However, convicts are taking shelter of the Article 21 of the Constitution which is available to them till their last breath,"" it said.
The court said it cannot be disputed that the convicts have adopted delay tactics to frustrate the warrants and noted that Pawan has not filed curative petition and mercy petition, after dismissal of his review petition by the apex court on July 9, 2018.
""Therefore, in the interest of justice, I hereby direct the convicts to take steps if they wish to make any type of petition before any institutions/authorities available under law within one week from today, failing which this Court expects from the institutions/authorities concerned to deal, as per the law applicable on delay, if any, without further delay,"" the judge said.
The court said it cannot be disputed that ""all convicts have been found to be guilty of a horrible, ghastly, gruesome and heinous offence of rape coupled with a bone chilling murder of a young girl which shocked the conscience of the society at large"".
""However, so long as life lasts, so long shall it be the duty and endeavour of the Court to give to the provisions of our Constitution a meaning which will prevent human suffering and degradation.
""Therefore, Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) is as much relevant at the stage of execution of the death sentence as it is in the interregnum between the imposition of that sentence and its execution. The essence of the matter is that all procedure, no matter what the stage, must be fair, just and reasonable,"" it said.
The court also referred to the top court's verdict in the case of Yakub Abdul Razak Memon, who was executed for his role in the 1993 Mumbai blasts, in which it was observed that the law permits the convict to move a subsequent mercy petition even after dismissal of mercy petition case of change in circumstances.
""Thus, convict Mukesh cannot be adversely segregated from the similarly placed convicts simply because he has been sincerely and earnestly pursuing his legal remedies,"" it said.
The court said as per the Prison rules, it was clear that if the appeal or application of one of the convicts is pending, the death sentence of all the convicts shall be postponed till the order on the appeal/application comes.
It is also mentioned in the proviso that if a petition for mercy has been submitted, the execution of the sentence shall further be postponed pending the orders of the President thereon.
""In said proviso, it is nowhere mentioned that if mercy petition of one convict is pending, the death sentence of other co-convicts shall be executed,"" the court said.
The trial court had on January 7 issued black warrants for the execution of all the four convicts in Tihar jail at 7 AM on January 22. However, they could not be hanged due to pendency of mercy petition of one of them.
On January 17, the trial court fixed February 1, 6 AM as the hanging date and time.
On January 31, the trial court again stayed the execution as the counsel for three convicts -- Pawan, Vinay and Akshay -- urged it to adjourn the matter ""sine die"" saying their legal remedies were yet to be exhausted.
While the mercy pleas of Mukesh, Vinay and Akshay have been rejected by the President, Pawan has not yet filed it.
23-year-old paramedic student Nirbhaya was raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, before being thrown out on the road. She died on December 29, 2012.

Nirbhaya's parents have been desperately seeking justice for her.
New Delhi:
Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi said on Wednesday that she will be happy only on the day when convicts in the 2012 gangrape and murder of her daughter are hanged, shortly after the Delhi High Court gave a week's time to the four to exhaust all legal remedies.
""I am satisfied but I will be happy only on the day when the convicts will be hanged. The court has given them a week's time, we will wait till then. This was the government's appeal and the government will think over it how early could they be hanged,"" she said.

It also blamed the authorities concerned for not taking steps to issue death warrants after the rejection of appeals of the accused by the Supreme Court in 2017.
Justice Suresh Kumar Kait directed the convicts to exhaust within seven days all the remedies available to them after which the authorities should act as per law. The court, however, said, ""It cannot be disputed that the convicts have frustrated the process by using delaying tactics.""

The trial court on January 7, had issued black warrants for the execution of all the four convicts.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court will on Wednesday pronounce order on the Centre's plea challenging stay on the execution of four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.
Justice Suresh Kumar Kait had on February 2 reserved order on the Centre's plea after holding special hearings on Saturday and Sunday.
The Centre and the Delhi government challenged the trial court's January 31 order staying ""till further orders"" the execution of all the four convicts in the case -- Mukesh Kumar Singh, 32, Pawan Gupta, 25, Vinay Kumar Sharma, 26 and Akshay Kumar, 31, who are lodged in Tihar Jail.
Earlier in the day, the parents of the victim urged the court to expeditiously decide the Centre's plea and were assured by the judge that the order would be passed at the earliest.
The trial court on January 7, had issued black warrants for the execution of all the four convicts in Tihar jail at 7 AM on January 22. However, they could not be hanged due to the pendency of the mercy petition of one of them.
Later, on January 17, the trial court fixed February 1, 6 AM as the hanging date and time.
On January 31, the trial court again stayed the execution as the counsel for three convicts -- Pawan, Vinay, and Akshay -- urged it to adjourn the matter ""sine die"" saying their legal remedies were yet to be exhausted.
While the mercy pleas of Mukesh and Vinay have been rejected by the President, Pawan has not yet filed it. Akshay's mercy plea was filed on February 1 and is pending.
The Centre and Delhi government approached the high court on February 1, challenging the trial court's order staying the execution.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing them, had contended that it was a deliberate and calculated design of the convicts to ""frustrate mandate of law"" by getting their execution delayed and they were not entitled to any more time.
The counsel for the convicts opposed the plea saying it was not maintainable and that the Centre was never a party in the case proceedings before the trial court and while the government was accusing the convict of delay, it has woken up only now.
Nirbhaya, a 23-year-old paramedic student, was raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons, before being thrown out on the road.
She died on December 29, 2012, in Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital.
One of the six accused in the case, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in the Tihar Jail.
A juvenile, who was among the accused, was convicted by a juvenile justice board and was released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.
The top court, in its 2017 verdict, had upheld the capital punishment awarded to the convicts by the Delhi High Court and the trial court.

Akshay Thakur filed the mercy plea today, jail officials said.
New Delhi:
One of the convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case Akshay Thakur has filed a mercy plea, jail officials said. This comes hours after the President rejected a similar plea filed by Vinay Sharma, another convict in the case.
Akshay Thakur and three other convicts were to be hanged today but a Delhi court indefinitely postponed their hanging.
""Akshay Thakur filed a mercy plea before President Ram Nath Kovind on Saturday,"" Director General (Prison) Sandeep Goel said today.
Four men - Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta, Mukesh Singh and Akshay Singh - convicted in the 2012 gangrape and killing of a 23-year-old paramedical student in Delhi were due to be executed at 6 am today, but late last evening a Delhi court, noting that a decision had not yet been taken on Vinay Sharma's mercy plea, handed them a last-minute reprieve, yet again.
The four will now not hang until further orders in the case, Delhi's Patiala House Court said.
On December 16, 2012, the young woman who came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" was gang-raped by six men, tortured with an iron rod and thrown off the vehicle. She died on December 29.
The savage assault stunned the nation and angry protesters filled the streets demanding justice.
Of the six men, one was found hanging in jail. The youngest, just short of 18 when the crime was committed, was released after three years in a reform home.

Victim's counsel also demanded maximum punishment for the convicts. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Thursday awarded 20-years imprisonment to two men in the 2013 kidnapping and rape case of a five-year-old girl, Gudiya (not her real name).
Additional Sessions Judge Naresh Kumar Malhotra also directed authorities concerned to pay Rs 11 lakh as compensation to the victim.
A Delhi court had on January 18 convicted the two -- Manoj Shah and Pradeep -- for raping a minor girl at a rented accommodation in East Delhi in April 2013.
During the arguments over sentencing, the public prosecutor requested the court to award maximum punishment to the convicts in the matter and said that ""it was a miracle the girl survived despite grievous injuries.""
Victim's counsel and senior advocate HS Phoolka also demanded maximum punishment for the convicts.
Phoolka said that the convict Manoj has shown no remorse and no change in behaviour ""as he slapped a journalist outside the courtroom after being convicted by the court"" adding that convict Pradeep tried to stall the case proceedings by submitting false certificate claiming to be juvenile during the incident.
On the other hand, Manoj's defence sought leniency on the ground that Manoj, 30-year-old belongs to a poor family, which includes elderly parents to be taken care of.
The gang-rape survivor was found with candles and plastic bottles inside her body. The minor was held captive by the convicts who raped and tortured her.
The case had come to the fore after the girl was reported missing on April 15, 2013. The minor victim stayed in the same building where the accused were residing. She was rescued on April 17 morning from the ground floor of the same building. She was admitted to a hospital where three were conducted.
A case under charges of kidnapping, rape and attempt to murder was registered against both them for confining her to a room for two days.

The plea of Akshay Singh will be heard by the Supreme Court judges in their chambers tomorrow
New Delhi:
One of the four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gang rape case to be hanged on Saturday has challenged his execution using the last legal resort in the Supreme Court known as the curative petition. Akshay Singh, 31, is the third convict to challenge his hanging with the method in a case that has been criticised for its duration and his petition makes his hanging over the weekend unlikely.
The plea of Akshay Singh will be heard by the Supreme Court judges in their chambers tomorrow and not in an open court. After the curative petition is rejected, Akshay Singh will have the option to send a mercy plea to President Ram Nath Kovind.
Last month, the Supreme Court had rejected Akshay Singh's petition seeking a review of his death sentence after he filed a plea making bizarre claims, including citing Hindu religious texts and the Delhi pollution crisis as reasons why the hanging should not be carried out.
The top court on Wednesday also rejected a petition by one of the other convicts, Mukesh Kumar Singh, 32, who had challenged the rejection of his mercy request citing ""non-application of mind"" by the President of India.
Besides Akshay and Mukesh Singh, two others - Vinay Sharma, 26, and Pawan Gupta, 26, are due to be executed on Saturday at Delhi's Tihar jail. A fifth convict, who was a juvenile at the time of the crime, was sent to a remand home and later released.
Mukesh Singh and Vinay Sharma's curative petitions have already been rejected.
Last-minute petitions by the convicts have been widely seen as desperate attempts to stall their hanging. The delay has been criticised by many including parents of the woman who was raped and left to die.
The government last week asked the Supreme Court for a change in guidelines in death row cases so convicts cannot keep delaying the sentence by exploiting legal options. The current rules are skewed towards convicts and allows them to ""play with the law and delay execution,"" the centre said in its petition.
On December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old medical student was gang-raped and savagely assaulted on a moving bus in South Delhi. She died of her injuries a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital, triggering a massive outpouring of public anger, and came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" or fearless.

Brajesh Thakur is one of the key accused in Muzaffarpur shelter rape case.
New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Tuesday deferred for a week the hearing of arguments on quantum of sentence of Brajesh Thakur and 18 others, convicted of sexually and physically assaulting several minor girls in a shelter home in Muzaffarpur in Bihar.
Additional Sessions Judge Sudesh Kumar adjourned the hearing till February 4 as Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha, who had conducted the trial, was on leave.
The court had on January 20 convicted Thakur, who once unsuccessfully contested assembly polls on Bihar People''s Party (BPP) ticket, of several offences including aggravated penetrative sexual assault under section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, and offences of rape and gang rape under the Indian Penal code (IPC).
In its bulky judgement running into 1,546 pages, the court had also convicted Thakur of offences under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 324 (causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and abetment under IPC, section 21 (failure to report commission of an offence) of the POCSO Act section 75 (cruelty to child) of Juvenile Justice Act.
The offences entail a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.
It, however, acquitted one Vikki in the case for want of evidence.
One of the female accused, Rosy Rani, former assistant director of child protection unit in Muzaffarpur, was convicted of offences under section 21(1) (failure to report commission of an offence) of the POCSO Act.
Since the maximum punishment for the offence was six months, which she had already undergone, she was granted bail by the court.
Dillip Kumar Verma, former chairman of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) of Muzaffarpur, child protection officer of District Child Protection Unit Ravi Roshan, member of CWC Vikas Kumar and other accused Vijay Kumar Tiwari, Guddu Patel, Kishan Kumar and Ramanuj Thakur were held guilty of the offences of aggravated penetrative sexual assault under POCSO Act, criminal conspiracy, rape, gang rape, causing hurt, abetment to rape under IPC and POCSO Act, and section 75 of the JJ Act.
Two of the accused -- Rama Shankar Singh and Dr Ashwani-- were convicted of the offences of criminal conspiracy and abetment to rape.
Rama was also convicted under sections 323 of IPC, 75 of JJ Act and 21 of POCSO Act.
Female accused -- Shaista Praveen, Indu Kumari, Minu Devi, Manju Devi, Chanda Devi, Neha Kumari, Hema Masih, Kiran Kumari -- were held guilty of criminal conspiracy, abetment to rape, cruelty to child and failure to report commission of an offence.
Advocates P K Dubey and Nishaank Mattoo, appearing for Thakur, had told reporters that they will challenge the verdict in the higher court.
Advocate Gyanendra Mishra, representing Dillip, too had said there was no evidence against the accused and he will challenge the judgement in the higher court.
The court had recorded the statement of 69 witnesses produced by the CBI which was represented by Public Prosecutor Amit Jindal.
It had recorded the statement of 44 girls who were physically and sexually assaulted at the shelter home, of which around 13 were mentally disabled.
It had examined 20 defence witnesses, said advocate Dheeraj Kumar, appearing for some of the accused.
The court had on March 30, 2019, framed charges against the accused in the case in which former Bihar Social Welfare Minister and the then JD(U) leader Manju Verma also faced flak as allegations surfaced that Thakur had links with her husband.
She had resigned from her post on August 8, 2018.
The case was transferred on February 7, 2019 from a local court in Muzaffarpur in Bihar to a POCSO court at Saket district court complex in Delhi on the apex court's directions.
The matter had come to light on May 26, 2018 after Tata Institute of Social Sciences submitted a report to the Bihar government highlighting the alleged sexual abuse of minor girls in the shelter home for the first time.
The report had been submitted to the Bihar Social Welfare Department by TISS in February that year.

Nirbhaya Case: The hanging of all four is to take place on February 1 at 6 am.
A Delhi court on Saturday said no further directions were required on a petition by the lawyer of the death row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case alleging the prison authorities were not handing over certain documents required to file mercy and curative petitions, and disposed of the petition.
Additional Sessions Judge Ajay Kumar Jain said the convicts' lawyer can take pictures of the relevant documents, diary and paintings from the Tihar jail authorities.
The public prosecutor, appearing for the Delhi Police, told the court that the Tihar jail authorities have given all the relevant documents sought by the lawyer of the death row convicts in the case.
He claimed that the convicts are only adopting ""delaying tactics"".
""The entire process is to defeat the law. We have already supplied all the documents. We procured all the documents from all the jails where they went,"" the counsel said.
He then produced before the court the diary of one of the convicts, Vinay Kumar Sharma, which he had named ''Darinda'', and several paintings and other documents.
""These are all we have. If the court directs, we can hand these over to the convicts right now,"" the counsel said.
Advocate AP Singh, appearing for the convicts, alleged that Vinay was being slow poisoned and was hospitalised, but his medical reports are not being supplied to him.
He further said though he had received some documents Friday night from the jail authorities, Vinay's personal diary and medical documents have not been supplied.
""They (Tihar jail authorities) say there is no such record. Vinay was being slow poisoned. That's why he was sent to hospital. Vinay made several paintings about that and we want to inform the President about it. Also, what he earned from those paintings needs to be informed,"" Mr Singh said.
He also alleged that another convict Pawan Singh's head was ""split open"" in Mandoli jail and he was shifted to a hospital but those documents were not supplied to the counsel too.
The documents related to the third convict Akshay Kumar Singh's health were also not supplied and were required to file his curative and mercy petitions, the lawyer said.
Mr Singh had moved an application alleging that the jail authorities were yet to give the documents which are required to file the mercy petition for Vinay (26) and curative petitions for Akshay (31) and Pawan (25).
The Supreme Court recently dismissed the curative petitions of other two convicts -- Vinay and Mukesh Singh (32). Mukesh's mercy petition was rejected by the President earlier this month.
The hanging of all four is to take place on February 1 at 6 am, according to the court order.
The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before she was thrown out on the road. She was flown to a hospital in Singapore where she died.

Bihar Shelter Case: Brajesh Thakur found guilty by a Delhi court
New Delhi:
Brajesh Thakur, who ran the shelter in Bihar's Muzaffarpur where girls were raped and physically assaulted over a period of several months, was today found guilty by a Delhi court. Brajesh Thakur was convicted for aggravated sexual assault under the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act. In addition, 19 of 20 accused - eight women and 12 men - including the former Bihar People's Party MLA, were found guilty on a number of other charges, including criminal conspiracy to commit rape and penetrative sexual assault against minors.
All 19 convicts will be sentenced on January 28 at 10 am. The offences entail a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.
In a case that shocked the nation, young girls were forced to dance to vulgar songs, sedated and raped at the government-run shelter in a scandal that exposed the role of politicians and bureaucrats.
The fallout of the case included the resignation of Manju Verma, a member of the ruling Janata Dal United in the state and then the Social Welfare Minister, after it emerged that Brajesh Thakur had links with her husband.
On Saturday the court dismissed a plea filed by Brajesh Thakur asking for witness testimonies to be dismissed on grounds of unreliability.
Additional Sessions Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha rejected the plea on grounds the case relating to sexual assault was different from that of the alleged murder of some of them, according to a report by news agency PTI.
Brajesh Thakur's petition claimed prosecution witnesses in shelter home sexual assault case were untrustworthy as investigations into the allegations of murder were based on their statements.
""It is pertinent to mention that the investigation into the allegations of murder were based on the statements made by the prosecutrixes (rape survivors) who are prosecution witnesses in the case,"" the petition claimed, adding, ""They had levelled false allegations against the accused before the court including inter alia allegations pertaining to murder"".
The plea further alleged the case by prosecution witnesses was ""false, fabricated and concocted"".
Earlier this month, in a dramatic twist to the case, 35 girls suspected to have been killed were found alive, the CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) told the Supreme Court.
This came after the probe agency told the court they had found a ""bundle of bones"" and that the politically-connected Brajesh Thakur and his accomplices may have killed 11 girls.
The CBI subsequently said two skeletons recovered during investigations were those of a man and a woman, and no evidence of any minor being murdered had been found.
The CBI said it was distinguishing between cases of sexual assault and those of murder against Brajesh Thakur and that it had not given him a clean chit in either.
The Muzaffarpur shelter home case came to light in May 2018 after the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) submitted a report to the Bihar government that highlighted instances of sexual abuse.
After the case made headlines the Bihar government shifted the girls to other protection homes and, on May 31, 2018, lodged an FIR against the accused. The Supreme Court took cognisance of the matter in August and transferred the probe to the CBI on November 28.

""Both accused in the Gudiya rape case were found guilty. It took seven years. We need to correct this system. If we want to ensure that no one misbehaves with our sisters and daughters, we need to develop a system which ensures that accused are punished within six months,"" Mr Kejriwal tweeted.
Gudiya, a five-year-old girl, was raped and brutalised barely four months after the Nirbhaya case that shocked and horrified the entire nation.

The two convicts had kept the girl in a room for at least two days
New Delhi:
Two men accused of kidnapping and brutally raping a five-year-old girl in Delhi in 2013 have been held guilty by a court in the national capital today. The POCSO court, which will announce the quantum of punishment on January 30, said, ""In our society the minor girls are worshipped as goddess on certain occasions but in the present case the victim child had experienced exceptional depravity and extreme brutality.""
""The crime against the victim was committed in a most grotesque and revolting manner and the collective conscience of the community was shaken,"" the court added while holding the accused - Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar - guilty.
The assault which took place just four months after Nirbhaya's brutal rape had grabbed headlines with its shocking details. The girl, who was named Gudiya by sections of the media, went missing and the police told her parents to look for her themselves. She was found two days later, tied in the basement of the east Delhi house she lived in with traces of candles and bottles inside her private parts.
The convicts had fled after raping Gudiya and shoving a candle and bottle inside her private parts, leaving her at Manoj Shah's room, after believing the five-year-old to be dead. The child was rescued 40 hours later on April 17, 2013.
Manoj Shah and Pradeep Kumar were arrested by Delhi police separately from Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga in Bihar respectively in 2013. The charge sheet was filed on May 24 that year and charges were framed by the court on July 11. But, it took more than five years to complete the recording of the statement of 57 prosecution witnesses in the POCSO court.
""Though the trial should have been completed in two years, we are happy we got justice,"" said the father of the girl.
One of the convicts, Manoj Shah, allegedly assaulted some reporters while being taken out of the courtroom.

Nirbhaya Case: Asha Devi blamed ""people like Indira Jaising"" for continued rape incidents. (File)
New Delhi:
Asha Devi, mother of the 23-year-old medical student who was raped and fatally injured by four men on a bus in Delhi in 2012 triggering an unprecedented outpouring of public anger, has hit out at senior lawyer Indira Jaising for requesting her to ""forgive"" the convicts and stop their execution.
""Can't believe how Indira Jaising even dared to suggest such this. I met her many times over the years in Supreme Court, not once did she ask for my wellbeing and today she is speaking for convicts. Such people make a living by supporting rapists, hence rape incidents don't stop,"" Asha Devi told news agency ANI.
""Who is Indira Jaising to give me such a suggestion? Whole country wants the convicts to be executed. Just because of people like her, justice is not done with rape victims,"" she added.
On Friday, Indira Jaising had requested Asha Devi to follow the example of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, who had moved for the clemency of a woman Nalini Murugan convicted for the assassination of her husband and former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
""While I fully identify with the pain of Asha Devi I urge her to follow the example of Sonia Gandhi who forgave Nalini and said she didn't not want the death penalty for her. We are with you but against death penalty,"" Ms Jaising had tweeted.
Asha Devi has criticised the delay in the execution of the four men convicted of the rape and murder of her daughter, saying that the case was being used for political mileage.
A Delhi court had on Friday said the four convicts - Mukesh, 32, Vinay Sharma, 26, Akshay Kumar Singh, 31, and Pawan Gupta, 25 - will hang on February 1 at 6 am. The execution had earlier been scheduled for January 22 but was delayed over a mercy petition filed by one of them.
The 2012 attack on the 23-year-old physiotherapy student, who came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" or ""fearless', had shocked India and triggered widespread protests.

Nirbhaya Case: Smriti Irani attacked the Arvind Kerjiwal government today. (File)
New Delhi:
Union Minister Smriti Irani on Friday said it was because of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi that the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya case couldn't be hanged in a time-bound manner after their review petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court in July last year.
""Why was the prison department, which comes under the AAP government, sleeping after the dismissal of review petition in July 2018? Why did the government give Rs 10,000 and a sewing kit to the juvenile rapist when he was released? Didn't they see tears of Nirbhaya's mother?"" she was quoted by news agency ANI as saying.
""I want to tell the Aam Aadmi Party that after the rejection of the review petition, because of you the convicts couldn't be hanged in time. Such parties should be shamed- this is not only my party's view but also of every law abiding citizen of the country,"" she added.
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, in response to Ms Irani's attack, said there shouldn't be any politics over the issue.
""I feel sad politics is being done on such issue. Shouldn't we be working together to ensure that the guilty are hanged soonest? Shouldn't we join hands to ensure a system so that such beasts get hanged within 6 months? Please don't do politics on this. Lets together create a safe city for our women,"" Mr Kejriwal tweeted.
I feel sad politics being done on such issue. Shudn't v be working together to ensure guilty r hanged soonest? Shudn't v join hands to ensure a system so that such beasts get hanged within 6 months? Pl don't do politics on this. Lets together create a safe city for our women https://t.co/tl0eJ6fYKO

Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Singh, Akshay Kumar Singh and Pawan Gupta were to be hanged at Delhi's Tihar Jail on January 22, the trial court judge had declared last week, signing a death warrant seven years after a young medical student was gang-raped on a moving bus, tortured and killed.

The Delhi government, however, told the High Court on Tuesday that the hanging would have to be postponed as Mukesh Singh had filed a mercy petition with the President. According to the rules, the government counsel said, the convicts would have to be given a 14-day notice even if their mercy pleas were rejected. On Thursday, the Tihar jail asked for a fresh date for the execution.
Today, after the mercy plea of Mukesh Singh was rejected by the President, fresh death warrants were issued for the convicts, who will now be executed at 6 am on February 1.
Earlier today, Mr Kejriwal hit back at allegations that his AAP government was to blame for delays in the execution of the four Nirbhaya convicts. Mr Kejriwal said his government ""hardly has any role in it (the execution)"" and that whatever paperwork had to be filled out by the AAP was ""completed...within hours"".

Fresh death warrants have been issued for Nirbhaya case convicts.
New Delhi:
Fresh death warrants were issued this evening for the four men convicted of the gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old medical student in Delhi in 2012. The four will now be executed at 6 am on February 1, Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora said today, while also turning down a plea by Mukesh Singh, one of the convicts, to postpone the execution. The warrants were issued mere hours after President Ram Nath Kovind rejected a mercy plea filed by the same convict.
The new death warrants are dated to exactly 14 days from today, in accordance with a law that states convicts to be executed must have a reprieve from the time their mercy plea is turned down.
Vinay Sharma, Mukesh Singh, Akshay Kumar Singh and Pawan Gupta were to be hanged at Delhi's Tihar Jail on January 22, the same trial court judge had declared last week, signing a death warrant more than seven years after the young girl was gang-raped on a moving bus, tortured and killed.
However, on Thursday, five days before the scheduled execution, Tihar officials asked for a new date, saying the executions could not take place till after all mercy pleas were settled.
Mukesh Singh had filed his mercy petition on Tuesday, directly after the Supreme Court dismissed a curative petition - the last legal appeal - moved by him and Vinay Sharma.
The petition had been forwarded to the President via the Home Ministry late Thursday night and was rejected this afternoon. Nirbhaya's mother, Asha Devi, had made a public appeal to the President to summarily reject the petition.
Earlier today Asha Devi also made a public appeal to politicians to not seek ""political gains"" over her daughter's death. Her comments came amid a war of words between the AAP - which rules Delhi - and the BJP - in power at the centre - over delays in the execution.
The three other convicts have yet to file their respective mercy petitions, which they may do at any time prior to their execution. Each time such a petition is filed and rejected, that 14-day period must be observed, thereby potentially prolonging the execution.
On December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old medical student was gang-raped and tortured on a moving bus before being dumped on a road in south Delhi. The woman, who came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"", died on December 29 in a Singapore hospital.
Six men were arrested for the horrifying assault. A fifth accused - Ram Singh - allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail during the trial and the sixth man, a few months short of 18 at the time of the incident, was released after three years in a reform facility.

Court Refuses To Suspend Kuldeep Sengar's Plea Challenging Life Term
The court allowed Kuldeep Sengar to deposit in 60 days the fine amount of Rs 25 lakh, out of which Rs 10 lakh will be released to the rape survivor

Kuldeep Singh Sengar was sentenced to life last month in the 2017 Unnao rape case.
New Delhi:
Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, sentenced to life imprisonment for raping a minor girl in Unnao in 2017, failed to get any interim relief on Friday from the Delhi High Court which refused to suspend his sentence and sought CBI's response on his appeal challenging the conviction.
The court also sought the survivor's reply on Sengar's appeal challenging his conviction and imprisonment till remainder of his natural life.
A bench of justices Manmohan and Sangeeta Dhingra Sehgal allowed Sengar to deposit in 60 days the fine amount of Rs 25 lakh, out of which Rs 10 lakh will be released to the rape survivor without any condition.
During the hearing, the court said it was not inclined to suspend the sentence or fine amount of Sengar as he is an undertrial in other cases also, after which his counsel withdrew the application for suspension of the sentence.
""Too much tragedy happened with the survivor in this case. In the facts of the case, we are not inclined to suspend the sentence. You have to pay Rs 10 lakh to the survivor. There can be no condition to it,"" the bench said.
""You cannot be released because you are an undertrial in other cases also in which trial is going on. You have a judgement of trial court against you, you are a convict today, you have to be in custody. The presumption of innocence does not lie to you today. You have been in jail only for one and a half years. We are not suspending the sentence,"" it said.
Sengar's advocate claimed he does not have money to deposit the fine amount as he was the sole earning member in the family, has two daughters of marriageable age.
He said he was facing difficulty in arranging Rs 25 lakh and the trial court had only given him time till January 20 to deposit the amount and urged the court that the time be extended.
The counsel for CBI said Sengar's wife was also a public servant and he should first pay Rs 10 lakh as directed by the trial court to the rape survivor and rest Rs 15 lakh is to be deposited with the court.
The bench has now posted the appeal for May 4 in the category of ''regular matters''.
Sengar has sought quashing of the December 16, 2019 judgement of the trial court which convicted him. He has also sought setting aside of the December 20 order sentencing him to imprisonment till remainder of his life.
The trial court had convicted the 54-year-old Sengar under various provisions including Section 376 (2) of IPC which deals with the offence of rape committed by a public servant who ""takes advantage of his official position and commits rape on a woman in his custody as such public servant or in the custody of a public servant subordinate to him"".
In his plea, Sengar alleged the trial court committed egregious factual errors and he has been wrongly convicted based on a judgment which goes beyond the boundaries of perversity.
The trial court had awarded him the maximum punishment of life term with a rider that the convict will remain in jail for ""remainder of his natural biological life"" and also imposed an exemplary fine of Rs 25 lakh on him to be paid within a month.
The woman was kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor.
The trial, which started on August 5 last year after it was transferred from Unnao to Delhi on the Supreme Court's directions, was carried on a day-to-day basis.
The top court, taking cognisance of the rape survivor's letter written to the then Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had on August 1 last year transferred all five cases registered in connection with the Unnao rape incident from a Lucknow court in Uttar Pradesh to the court in Delhi with directions to hold trial on a daily basis and completing it within 45-days.

Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi called out the politics over the delay in the execution.
New Delhi:
Asha Devi, mother of the 23-year-old medical student who was raped and fatally injured by four men on a bus in Delhi in 2012 triggering an unprecedented outpouring of public anger, has said that the case is being used for political mileage.
""Those who attacked my daughter are being given a thousand options, but we have no rights? Till now, I never talked about politics, but now I want to say that those people who held protests on streets in 2012, today the same people are only playing with my daughter's death for political gains,"" she told news agency ANI, wiping away her tears.
Her comments come amid a blame game between the BJP which rules at the centre and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which governs Delhi over the delay in the execution of four men convicted of the rape and murder.
At a news conference on Thursday, BJP leader and union minister Prakash Javadekar had said all four convicts would have been hanged by now had the AAP government acted quickly and served notices to them immediately after the Supreme Court rejected their appeal against death sentence in 2017.
Hitting back at the BJP, Deputy Chief Minister and AAP leader Manish Sisodia said if central government handed over the capital's law and order to his government for two days, the hangings would be carried out immediately.
""If they have not been hanged yet, it is due to the AAP government's negligence... This delay of over two and a half years is due to the complicity of Delhi's AAP government. It has sympathies with these convicts, and this (delay) is a result of that,"" Mr Javadekar said.
However, Mr Sisodia and his party colleague Sanjay Singh said the BJP leader was ""lying"".
""Javadekar ji, police is under you (centre), responsibility of law and order is under you, home ministry is under you, Tihar DG and administration is under you and you are blaming us. Please don't stoop so low on a sensitive issue,"" Sisodia said.
A Delhi court today said the four convicts - Mukesh, 32, Vinay Sharma, 26, Akshay Kumar Singh, 31, and Pawan Gupta, 25 - will hang on February 1 at 6 am. The execution had earlier been scheduled for January 22.
The prosecution has claimed that the four men were ""frustrating"" and ""intentionally"" delaying the legal process by filing curative and mercy pleas in stages to postpone their execution.
The 2012 attack on the 23-year-old physiotherapy student, who came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" or ""fearless', had shocked India and triggered widespread protests.
The protest had seen the leaders of the BJP, and the then newly-launched Aam Aadmi Party jumping into the fray, targeting the Congress party which was in power both in Delhi and the centre at the time.

Arrangements for hanging the four men convicted in the Nirbhaya gang-rape case. (File)
New Delhi:
Four convicts in Nirbhaya gang rape case, whose execution is just a week away, earned nearly Rs 1,37,000 as prison wages during their stay in Delhi's Tihar Jail in the last seven years, sources have said, adding that they broke prison rules 23 times during this period.
Convicts Akshay Thakur Singh, Mukesh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma were found guilty in the 2012 gang-rape, torture and killing of a young medical student in Delhi. They will be hanged at 7 am on January 22, a Delhi court had said earlier this month, signing a death warrant.
While Vinay was punished 11 times for breaking prison rules during his stay in prison, Akshay was punished once, Mukesh broke rules thrice, and Pavan broke rules eight times.
In the last seven years, Mukesh chose not to do any labour work, Akshay earned Rs 69,000 as prison wages, Pawan earned Rs 29,000, and Vinay earned Rs 39,000, sources said.
In 2016, three convicts - Mukesh, Pawan and Akshay - took admission for Class 10th and appeared for exams but couldn't pass. Vinay, in 2015, took admission in a bachelor's degree program but he couldn't complete it.
The family of all the convicts have been allowed to meet them twice before the hanging. Vinay, the convict who has got the maximum punishment, is reportedly the most anxious. His father visited him on Tuesday.
Arrangements for hanging the four men convicted in the gang-rape, torture and killing of a young medical student in Delhi in 2012 began last month. The convicts have been kept in different cells and monitored through CCTV. A ""dummy execution"" was carried out at Tihar jail on Sunday to prepare for the execution.
The four men will be hanged together, a first in India. The Uttar Pradesh Prison authority has confirmed that Pawan Jallad from Meerut will be sent to hang the four convicts. He will be paid Rs 15000 per execution, sources said.
The Supreme Court has already turned down petitions against the death sentence from three of the convicts, and a mercy petition from a fourth has also been turned down. On Tuesday, Mukesh filed a mercy petition to President Ram Nath Kovind.
The 23-year-old paramedic student was gang-raped and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16, 2012, before being dumped on a road, naked and bleeding. She died on December 29 amid street protests across the country which named her Nirbhaya or ""fearless"".

""While committing such a heinous crime, these brutal people did not show any mercy, but now when they have been sentenced to death, they are scared for their lives. For such people, hanging is a small punishment. Their hanging will send out a strong message to those who have rapist mindset,"" Ms Maliwal tweeted in Hindi.

A five-judge bench of the Supreme Court will hear the curative petitions of the Nirbhaya convicts. (File)
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court will hear the curative petition of two death row convicts in 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape case against their death sentence on January 14.
A five-judge bench of Justices NV Ramana, Arun Mishra, RF Nariman, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan will hear the petition filed by Vinay Sharma and Mukesh.
The two convicts had filed a curative petition in the top court after a Delhi court issued a death warrant in their name and announced January 22 as the date of their execution.
Besides them, the two other convicts named Pawan and Akshay are also slated to be executed on the same day at 7 am at Delhi's Tihar Jail.
They were convicted and sentenced to death for raping a 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in the national capital on the night of December 16, 2012.
The woman, who was later referred to as ""Nirbhaya"", died at a hospital in Singapore where she had been airlifted for treatment.
A curative petition is the last judicial resort available for redressal of grievances. It is decided by the judges in-chamber.
If it is rejected, they are legally bound to move a mercy petition. It is filed before the President who has the power to commute it to life imprisonment.
The court after issuing a black warrant in their name gave them two weeks' time to file both the curative and mercy petition.

Four of the convicts were sentenced to death by a trial court in September 2013 (File Photo)
New Delhi:
A court in Delhi on Tuesday, while issuing death warrants for the four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case, observed that the four didn't exercise their legal remedies ""despite being afforded sufficient time and opportunity"".
Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora said: ""It is apparent from the record, sufficient time and opportunity was given to the convicts to exercise and exhaust their remedies as available to them under the law. Either the remedies have been exercised and exhausted by the respondents or have not been resorted to despite afforded sufficient time and opportunity.""
""In these given facts and circumstances when reasonable time and opportunity has been afforded to the convicts to exercise their remedies, there is nothing to delay any further in passing orders on the application seeking issuance of death warrants,"" the court said.
As the court was hearing the application filed by Nirbhaya's parents seeking to expedite the execution of the convicts in the case, the prosecution argued that no application is pending before any court or the President right now by any of the convicts.
""The review petition of all convicts are dismissed. In between issuance and execution of death warrants of the convicts want to file curative petitions, they can do so,"" the public prosecutor said.
""They can avail their pending legal remedies after issuance of death warrant also,"" said advocate Jitendra Jha who was representing the parents of the victim.
The amicus curiae and the counsel of the convicts however, pressed that certain legal remedies are still available with the convicts.
However, after concluding the arguments, the judge issued the death warrants and ordered for their execution, but, granted them 14 days' time to exercise their remedies.
The 23-year-old woman was gang-raped and tortured on December 16, 2012, which led to her death. All the six accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. One of the accused was a minor and appeared before a juvenile justice court, while another accused committed suicide in Tihar Jail.
Four of the convicts were sentenced to death by a trial court in September 2013, and the verdict confirmed by the Delhi High Court in March 2014 and upheld by the Supreme Court in May 2017, which also dismissed their review petitions.

Seven Years After Nirbhaya Died, 4 Convicts To Hang On January 22 At 7 am.
New Delhi:
With a Delhi court Tuesday ordering the hanging of four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case for January 22, here is a look at India's record on death penalties and their execution.
The convicts have time till then to file curative petitions in the top court which may or may not be entertained, legal experts said.
Apart from filing curative pleas, every other legal remedy has been exhausted by them, the experts said.
""They will be filing a curative. That is the only remedy left. Otherwise, everything is final. Nobody can stop it (the curative pleas) but will it be entertained is the question. They have time till January 22,"" senior advocate Ajit Sinha said.
Parliament had last year expanded the scope of the death penalty by introducing it in cases of rape of girls below 12 years under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO).
As per the Project 39A report on the death penalty released by National Law University in Delhi, between 2000 and 2014 trial courts sentenced 1,810 people to death. More than half of these sentences were commuted to life imprisonment, and 443 people or about a quarter of the convicts, were acquitted by the Supreme Court and high courts.
The Supreme Court had upheld the death sentence of 73 of these prisoners, out of which many had already spent a decade on death row.
The apex court in 2018 commuted 11 death sentences to life imprisonment while confirming them in three cases in the review plea hearing of the Nirbhaya gang-rape case.
Former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi had heard death penalty cases on priority by constituting four benches, each comprising three judges, which sat simultaneously for over 6 weeks to decide the cases of capital punishment.
The apex court had confirmed seven death penalties in 2017 whereas in 2016 it had confirmed capital punishment in one case and commuted seven.
However, the trial courts in India sentenced 162 persons to the gallows in 2018, which was the highest in nearly two decades, since 2000. Of these, 45 included cases of murder, and 58 murder-and-sexual offences.
The high courts confirmed 23 death sentences in 2018 whereas they commuted 58 of them and remitted 10 cases. The year saw acquittal in 23 cases in high courts.
As per the Project 39A data on death penalty, as many as 720 prisoners have been executed in India since 1947. Half of these are accounted for by Uttar Pradesh, followed by Haryana, 90 and Madhya Pradesh with 73 executions.
One of the initial executions of independent India, was of Nathuram Godse and Narain D Apte, assassins of Mahatma Gandhi; they were hanged to death in Ambala Central Jail in Haryana on November 15, 1949.
The crimes punishable with death term in India fall under The Prevention of Child Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) 2012, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989, Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act 1967, Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) 1999, Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) 1985, among others.
In 2018, with 22 cases of capital punishment, over four times more compared to 2017, Madhya Pradesh topped the list of states giving death penalty.
With 16 convicts being sentenced to capital punishment, Maharahstra was second in the list, closely followed by Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh with 15 cases each of death sentences.
According to Cornell Centre on the Death Penalty Worldwide, the last execution that had taken place in India was on July 30, 2015 of Yakub Memon, a convict in financing 1993 Mumbai bombings.
Prior to Memon, Muhammad Afzal Guru, who was convicted in the 2001 Parliament attack was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court on December 18, 2002.
He was hanged on February 9, 2013, ten years after his sentencing.
The special court had sentenced Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab, the 2008 Mumbai attack gunman, to death on May 6, 2010 and he was executed two years later on November 21, 2012 after the then President Pranab Mukherjee rejected his mercy petition. The top court had confirmed the sentence on August 29, 2012.
Both Qasab and Guru were executed in secrecy without informing their family members or the public of the President's decision. The world got to know only after the hangings had been carried out.

A juvenile involved in the crime was convicted by a juvenile justice board and released
New Delhi:
One of the four convicts facing the gallows in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case approached the Delhi High Court on Wednesday claiming that he was a juvenile at the time of the offence in December, 2012.
The plea filed by convict Pawan Kumar Gupta is listed for hearing on Thursday before Justice Suresh Kumar Kait.
Seeking to be declared a juvenile at the time of occurrence of the incident, Pawan alleged that his ossification test was not conducted by the investigating officers and claimed benefit under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.
He said in his plea that the provision of section 7A of JJ Act lays down that a claim of juvenility may be taken before any court and it shall be recognised at any stage, even after final disposal of the case.
Pawan, who was awarded death sentence and lodged in Tihar jail, sought that the concerned authority be directed to conduct his ossification test to ascertain his claim of juvenility.
Besides Pawan, the other three convicts in the case are Mukesh, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Kumar Singh.
A 23-year-old paramedic student was gang raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 in a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons before she was thrown out on the road. She died on December 29, 2012 at a hospital in Singapore.
A juvenile involved in the crime was convicted by a juvenile justice board and released from a reformation home after serving a three-year term.

Kuldeep Singh Sengar has been convicted of kidnapping and raping a girl in Unnao.
New Delhi:
When a Delhi court found expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar guilty of kidnapping and raping a teenage girl from Uttar Pradesh's Unnao in a high-profile case on Monday, its criticism was not reserved for the convict alone. District Judge Dharmesh Sharma also observed that the CBI had taken a ""patriarchal approach"" in investigating the case, caring little for the rape survivor or the ordeal she had undergone.
""In my considered opinion, this investigation suffered from a patriarchal approach or an inherent outlook to brush the issue of sexual violence against the children under the carpet, apart from exhibiting lack of sensitivity and a humane approach,"" the judge observed in his 10-page judgment, questioning the CBI over its delay in filing the chargesheet.
He also said it was ""insensitive"" of the CBI investigators to repeatedly summon the rape survivor without taking her trauma into account. ""The probe was not conducted by a woman officer, as mandated by Section 24 of the POCSO Act, and successive statements of the victim were recorded by calling her to the CBI office without bothering about the kind of harassment, anguish and re-victimisation that occurs to a victim of sexual assault in such a case,"" he said.
The case was being heard at Delhi's Tis Hazari court on a day-to-day basis from August 5, after it was transferred to Delhi from a Lucknow court on a Supreme Court directive. The sentencing of Kuldeep Sengar - a four-time MLA - is scheduled for today, with life imprisonment being the maximum possible punishment.
In his verdict, Judge Sharma also praised the rape survivor for having the courage to ""fight against a powerful person"" who had even foisted false cases against her family. ""The testimony of the (Unnao rape survivor) has been unblemished, truthful and has been proved to be of a sterling quality,"" he said.
The woman, who was a minor at the time of the assault, welcomed the judgment. ""Today, I received justice for the wrong that was done to me,"" she was quoted as saying by her lawyer.

Kuldeep Singh Sengar was found guilty of kidnapping and rape and will be sentenced tomorrow.
New Delhi:
Situation became tense this morning outside a courtroom at Tis Hazari District Court's Complex in New Delhi as soon as lawyers were told that the judge would pronounce at 3 pm the verdict in the 2017 Unnao rape case.
District Judge Dharmesh Sharma convicted expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar of kidnapping and raping a young girl from Uttar Pradesh's Unnao district two years ago.
Family members and relatives of Kuldeep Sengar and co-accused Shashi Singh, who was acquitted by the court, flocked the hall outside the courtroom for the judgement.
While some said it is a case of acquittal for the defence have concrete evidence against the prosecution, others said even if it is conviction, they will challenge it in the higher courts.
A police officer who was in-charge of the security at the court premises said the exact date and time should not be made public in the media as crowd control becomes difficult.
Around 2:15pm, the proceedings started with the judge asking for some clarifications from the counsel for the CBI and the accused. No one except the lawyers of both the parties and media personnel were allowed inside the courtroom.
Kuldeep Sengar and Shashi Singh were brought to the courtroom amid high security, including about 20 officials from the Delhi police, CRPF and female police officers, at 2:45pm.
Moments after the judgement was pronounced convicting Kuldeep Sengar, his family members broke down. As the former MLA's sister entered the courtroom and broke down beside him, Kuldeep Sengar too shed a few tears.
Kuldeep Sengar's sister was seen crying before the pronouncement of the verdict too as she had heard from one of her relatives that there were possibilities of his brother's conviction.
His brother-in-law and around 20 other relatives from his village broke down too outside the courtroom.
Meanwhile, as the judge started pronouncing the verdict for Shashi Singh, she fainted. Shashi Singh was accused of taking the rape survivor to Kuldeep Singh Sengar.
When she was brought to her senses, she started crying inconsolably.
The judge told her she was acquitted and then asked if they needed to call a doctor and ensure she was fine.
While Kuldeep Sengar was taken out from the courtroom to the lockup, the crowd outside tried to follow him but the situation was managed with the intervention of his lawyer.
Kuldeep Sengar's two daughters also burst into tears as their aunt tried to console them that their father did not do anything wrong and the fight was not over.
""The judgement was wrong and unfair. The fight is not over. We will fight,"" she told them.
The convict's lawyers said they will appeal against the verdict at higher courts.
The trial which started on August 5 this year after it was transferred from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi on the Supreme Court's directions, was carried on a day-to-day basis.
The court convicted Kuldeep Sengar, saying the rape survivor's testimony was ""truthful and unblemished"" against a ""powerful person"".
Sentencing is scheduled for tomorrow with the maximum possible punishment being life imprisonment.

Kuldeep Sengar, a four-time BJP MLA from UP's Bangermau, was expelled from the party.
New Delhi:
A Delhi court is likely to pronounce its judgement at 3 pm on Monday in the case of alleged kidnapping and rape of a woman by expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Unnao in 2017, court sources said.
The woman was allegedly kidnapped and raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor. The court has also framed charges against co-accused Shashi Singh in the case. Sengar, a four-time BJP MLA from UP's Bangermau, was expelled from the BJP in August 2019.
The court had on August 9 framed charges against the MLA and Singh under Sections 120 b (criminal conspiracy), 363 (kidnapping), 366 (kidnapping or inducing a woman to compel for marriage), 376 (rape) and other relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
The offences entail maximum punishment of life imprisonment.
During in-camera proceedings, District Judge Dharmesh Sharma had said he was likely to pronounce the verdict on December 16 after conclusion of hearing of final arguments by the CBI and the accused in the case.
The judge heard the case on a day-to-day basis from August 5 after it was transferred to Delhi from a court in Lucknow on Supreme Court's directions.
On July 28 this year, the car of the survivor was hit by a truck and she was severely injured. The woman's two aunts were killed in the accident and her family had alleged foul play.
Her father was allegedly framed in an illegal arms case and arrested on April 3, 2018. He died while in judicial custody a few days later, on April 9. The local court here has framed murder and other charges against the MLA, his brother Atul and nine others in the case.
The top court, taking cognisance of the rape survivor's letter written to the Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, had on August 1 transferred all five cases registered in connection with the Unnao rape incident from a Lucknow court in Uttar Pradesh to the court in Delhi with directions to hold trial on daily basis and completing it within 45-days.

Nirbhaya Rape Convicts Still Have Legal Remedies, Says Lawyer

Review petition by one of the convicts is listed for hearing before the top court on December 17.
New Delhi:
The counsel for the convicts of the gang-rape, torture and killing of a young girl in Delhi seven years ago has said that until all the legal remedies are exhausted, the execution cannot take place.
One of the Nirbhaya's convicts, Pawan Kumar Gupta, lodged in Mandoli jail in Delhi, was shifted to Tihar Jail recently, giving rise to the speculation that the convicts would be hanged on December 16.
AP Singh, the convicts' counsel, said that a lot of legal remedies, including the curative petition, are available with the convicts and only after these remedies are exhausted can the execution take place.
Mr Singh said that one of the convicts Vinay Sharma withdrew his mercy plea filed before the President of India. ""How can the government go ahead with the execution in view of this? Law is equal to all,"" Mr Singh said, adding with the legal remedies being available with the convicts, even the government and the jail authorities cannot proceed with the execution of the death penalty.
In December 2012, 6 people, including a juvenile male, gang-raped and tortured a 23-year-old paramedic student inside a moving bus in south Delhi.
Counsel of Nirbhaya's parents Jitendra Kumar Jha said the execution cannot happen as the review petition filed by one of the convicts Akshay Singh is listed for hearing before the Supreme Court on December 17.
""These legal remedies are delaying tactics by the defence as they want to capture some more breath for themselves,"" Mr Jha said, adding he would request the court to make this procedure time-bound in order to expedite the execution of the convicts.
Meanwhile, the Patiala House Court will on Friday continue hearing on the plea filed by Nirbhaya's parents seeking court's direction to expedite the execution process.
The court headed by judge Satish Kumar Arora had in last hearing directed the Tihar Jail authorities to submit a status report on the legal remedies available with the convicts. The court had also ordered the convicts to be produced before it on the next date of hearing on December 13.

A pamphlet with the threat was pasted outside the rape survivor's home in Baghpat.
Baghpat:
A rape survivor was threatened with consequences ""worse than Unnao"" if she testified in court against her rapist, in a pamphlet put up on her house at her village in western Uttar Pradesh's Baghpat, 53 km from Delhi. The message warning her against giving a statement before a Delhi court on Friday was pasted outside her home, the police said on Thursday.
The word ""Unnao"" in the threat sums up the tragedy of a young woman was beaten and set on fire by her alleged rapists last week on her way to a court hearing on her case. The woman died at a hospital in Delhi of 90 per cent burns.
The woman who was threatened with a similar fate was raped in Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar last year by a man from her village and had filed a police complaint in July. The rape accused was arrested and subsequently released on bail yesterday. The pamphlet surfaced around the same time.
""She said that the incident took place about a year ago when she was taken to a friend's place by Sohran Singh where she was given drugs in a beverage and then raped. The accused made a video of the incident and used it to blackmail and rape the victim again,"" Pratap Gopender Yadav, a senior police officer in Baghpat.
The accused has been arrested again from Badaun in western Uttar Pradesh. The police have also provided her security.
""There is no problem with her security now,"" the officer said.
""The woman's father works as a driver in Delhi. Yesterday, when they returned to their house in the village, they found the note pasted on the wall of their house,"" Mr Yadav said.
The man accused of raping her, however, said that some of his rivals in the village had put up the posters to implicate him.
The Unnao case had raised many questions including whether rape accused should be released on bail. The 23-year-old woman was set on fire by five men including the two alleged rapists. One of the two had been released just days before the incident. The woman was on her way to board a train to Rae Bareli to attend a court hearing in the rape case when she was doused with kerosene and set ablaze last Thursday. The Yogi Adityanath government came under fire, with the opposition parties attacking the ruling BJP. The Chief Minister said the case would be heard by a fast-track court.

Hyderabad:
A NHRC team, which launched an investigation five days ago into the ""encounter"" killing of four men suspected of the rape and murder of a veterinarian near here, returned to New Delhi on Wednesday after conducting its initialfact-finding, on-the-spot probe into the matter.
The seven-member investigative committee of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had arrived in Hyderabad on Saturday and commenced its inquiry.
""The NHRC team left on Wednesday after completion of (initial)inquiry (into the incident),"" a senior police official told news agency PTI.
On Tuesday, the Cyberabad Police probing the rape and murder had submitted relevant details and evidence in the case and also about the killing of the four accused to the panel.
The NHRC team, including a forensic medicine expert, had examined the bodies of the four accused in Mahabubnagar district where they were earlier kept in a state-run hospital after autopsy.
The team also visited Chattanpalli village, about 50 km from the city, the spot where the charred remains of the woman were found beneath a culvert on November 28, and also the encounter site nearby.
The committee also recorded statements of the family members of the accused and also interacted with the veterinarian.
The team also recorded statements of police officials, who were accompanying the four accused on December 6 while they were being taken to the crime scene, where the charred remains of the woman were found on November 28.
The NHRC took cognisance of the ""encounter"" killings and ordered a probe on Friday.
The top human rights body in the country had said the encounter was a matter of concern and needed to be investigated carefully.
""The commission is of the opinion that this matter is required to be probed very carefully. Accordingly, it has asked its Director General (Investigation) to immediately send a team for a fact-finding, on-the-spot investigation into the matter,"" the NHRC said.
The four were gunned down on December 6 morning at Chattanpalli when they were taken to the crime scene near the culvert, under which the charred remains of the 25-year-old veterinarian were found on November 28, to recover her phone, wrist-watch and others pertaining to the case.
The Cyberabad Police had said its personnel resorted to ""retaliatory"" firing after two of the accused opened fire at police after snatching their weapons besides attacking the latter with stones and sticks, resulting in injuries to two policemen.
The four were arrested on November 29 for allegedly raping and killing the woman by smothering her and later torching the body after dumping it under the culvert.

The lawyer told court that a complaint was filed with Delhi police to lodge an FIR. (Representational)
New Delhi:
The father of one of the four death-row convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case moved a Delhi court Wednesday seeking an FIR against the sole witness in the case for allegedly giving interviews to various news channels after charging money, claiming it affected the case by ""resulting into a media trial"", his lawyers said.
The sole eye-witness, a friend of the 23-year-old victim, was accompanying her in the bus when the incident took place and he had also sustained injuries.
The complaint, filed by Heera Lal Gupta, father of Pawan Kumar Gupta, cited some recent media reports which alleged that witness charged money to appear for interviews on various news channels, advocate A P Singh said.
""This calls for an independent investigation into the perjury that appears to have been committed by him (witness), being the sole witness, his testimony has strongly influenced the outcome of the case which led to the imposition of the death penalty of the accused,"" the complaint said.
Citing the reports, the advocate stated that ""on the basis of said facts and circumstances, it is clear that the conduct of him clearly shows that his testimony was false and fabricated... This goes to the root of his testimony and if established would show that the testimony in fact false.""
""It is quite clear that the sole eye witness in the case has accumulated lakhs of rupees in bribe from various news channels...and thus affected the case by resulting in media trial,"" the complaint said.
It said that based on witness'' ""false"" testimony the accused in  Nirbhaya gang-rape case was convicted and given capital punishment.
The lawyer told the court that a complaint was filed with Delhi police to lodge an FIR in this regard, however, no action was taken.
A Delhi court had recently directed Tihar Jail authorities to produce the four convicts before it on December 13 so that they can appraise the court about the status of their petitions.
The court was hearing a plea by the victim's parents who have sought a direction to the jail authorities to expedite the execution of the convicts.
The victim's parents had approached the court saying the convicts have exhausted all legal remedies.
In December last year, Nirbhaya's parents had approached the court to fast-track the procedure to hang all four convicts in the case.
The Supreme Court on December 12, 2018, had dismissed a PIL seeking direction to the Centre to execute the death penalty awarded to the four convicts -- Mukesh, Pawan, Vinay, and Akshay -- in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.
Nirbhaya is the changed name of the December 2012 gang rape-cum-murder victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern, who was gang-raped and brutalised in moving bus in South Delhi by six persons, including the bus driver, conductors, and helpers.
The woman had boarded the nearly vacant bus in Munirka in South Delhi along with her male friend on her way back home on December 16 that year. After raping and brutalising the woman and beating her friend, the assailants had thrown them out of the bus.
After receiving initial treatment in New Delhi for a few days, she was transferred to the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, where she succumbed to injuries on December 29, 2012.

The police official has written a letter to the Tihar Jail authorities in this regard. (Representational)
Chennai:
Forty-two year old Tamil Nadu police Head Constable S Subash Srinivasan, a police gallantry medal winner and grandson of INA veteran, has volunteered to hang the men convicted in the gang-rape, torture and killing of a young girl in Delhi seven years ago.
""I read a news report stating that no hangman was available to hang the killers of Nirbhaya. They had committed an unforgivable crime and their punishment should not be delayed on this account,"" Mr Srinivasan said.
He is working in the police department's In-Service Training Centre in Ramanathapuram district. His grandfather used to serve in Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army (INA).
Mr Srinivasan has already written a letter to the Tihar Jail authorities on December 6 and is waiting for a reply.
""I had also given my phone number. I am yet to get a call,"" Mr Srinivasan, who joined the police service in 1997, said. ""Their offence is unforgivable,"" he added.
He has taken a vow to tonsure his head and offer the hair to his family deity in case his wish to hang the Nirbhaya killers is fulfilled.
Mr Srinivsan won the gallantry medal in 2013. He recalled how a small girl had fallen into a well and to save that child her aunt also jumped into the well.
""I was having my lunch when I heard the commotion near my home. On learning about the child and her aunt struggling for life inside the well, I jumped in straight and managed to save both,"" Mr Srinivasan said.

Unnao case: The UP government has said it will do everything to bring the accused to justice
Lucknow:
One of the two men accused of raping a 23-year-old woman and setting her on fire in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao was given bail in the rape case on the condition that he should not influence witnesses. The woman received 90 per cent burn injuries and died during treatment at a hospital in Delhi, where she was airlifted on Thursday.
Five men, including two who were accused of raping the woman in December last year, set her on fire while she was on her way to a court for hearing in the rape case that was filed in March.
Shivam Trivedi - one of the two rape accused - got bail on November 25 from the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court, 10 days before he and the four men allegedly set the woman on fire.
""Applicant will not try to influence the witnesses or tamper with the evidence of the case or otherwise misuse the liberty of bail,"" the bail order said.
Though the bail plea was opposed by the government's lawyer, the court was told no complaint of rape had been filed for the last two years since the first time the woman alleged she was raped.
The woman's body has been sent to her home in Unnao after an autopsy, which said she died due to the severe burn injuries.
Her family today said they want Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to visit them and assure that the accused would be brought to justice within a week.
Her father said the accused should be ""shot"", referring to the killing of four rape accused by the Telangana Police.
""We demand that Yogi sir should visit us and give an immediate decision. I also demand that I should be given a government job,"" the sister of the woman said, according to news agency ANI.
The UP government said it has given a cheque of Rs 25 lakh to the family, a house would be built for them - they live in a hut - and the case will be heard in a fast-track court.
The woman's father, however, said he doesn't want money or the house but justice within a week.

In his letter to President Kovind, Vinay Sharma said his mercy plea was sent ""fraudulently"".
New Delhi:
Vinay Sharma, one of the four convicts in the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder case, on Saturday sought the withdrawal of his mercy plea from President Ram Nath Kovind, saying it was sent without his consent.
The convict wrote to the president, alleging his mercy plea, which was forwarded to him from the Ministry of Home Affairs, had been sent by the Tihar jail authorities with a ""malafide intention"" and in ""criminal conspiracy"" with the Delhi government.
Sharma said he was yet to exhaust all legal remedies available to him before filing the mercy plea as he has not filed any curative petition before the Supreme Court.
""It is therefore prayed to your kind honour that until the exhaustion of the judicial remedies, including those yet to be filed and/or pending in the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court by me as well as my co-accused, you may allow me to withdraw this mercy petition which has been filed without my consent and signature.
""Additionally, you are requested in the interim not to take any decision on my mercy petition,"" Sharma said in the letter, sent through his lawyer A P Singh.
In his letter to President Kovind, Sharma also said his mercy plea was sent ""fraudulently"", without attaching any document detailing the mitigating circumstances of his case and by concealing various important facts so that it is rejected.
The convict also pleaded that taking any step on his mercy plea would amount to a grave injustice as he was yet to exhaust all his judicial remedies.
A Delhi court had recently directed Tihar Jail authorities to produce the four convicts before it on December 13 so that they can brief the court about the status of their petitions.

Nawab Malik also asked if the accused were being shielded by the government machinery
Mumbai:
The NCP on Saturday demanded that trial in the Unnao case be fast-tracked after the victim, who was set ablaze on Thursday, died at a Delhi hospital.
NCP chief spokesperson Nawab Malik also asked if the accused were being shielded by the government machinery.
""We want the accused to be arrested at the earliest and punished through trial in a fast-track court,"" Mr Malik told reporters in Mumbai.
The 23-year-old Unnao rape victim, who was airlifted to Delhi and admitted to Safdarjung Hospital with 90 per cent burns, died on Friday night.
The woman was set ablaze by five men, including two of her alleged rapists, on Thursday morning when she was going to Rae Bareli to attend a court hearing.
The Uttar Pradesh government said on Saturday that the accused have all been arrested.
Mr Malik, meanwhile, also said demands of following the ""Telangana pattern"" in the Unnao case, from some quarters, are not right.
The four accused in the Hyderabad veterinarian's rape-murder case were killed in a police encounter on Friday.
""This is not right. In Hyderabad, people are saying, justice was delivered. But it was done in an unjust manner. Nobody has the right to punish someone,"" Mr Malik said, adding that proper judicial process be followed in the Unnao matter.
The NCP wants amendment to the law to ensure that trials of gang rape cases are completed within a stipulated period, and mercy petitions in such matters too should be decided within a fixed time, he said.
""Only then fear (of law) will be instilled,"" he added.

Chief Justice SA Bobde said that justice would lose its character if it becomes revenge.
Jodhpur:
Chief Justice of India SA Bobde on Saturday condemned the practice of extrajudicial killings, saying that justice loses its very character when it takes the form of revenge. The observation, made at an event in Jodhpur, comes amid a raging debate over the killing of four accused in the Telangana rape and murder case early on Friday.
""I don't think justice can ever be or ought to be instant. And justice must never ever take the form of revenge. I believe justice loses its character of justice if it becomes revenge,"" Chief Justice Bobde, who took over as the head of the Indian judiciary last month, said in his address at the inauguration of a new Rajasthan High Court building.
He, however, admitted that the country's judicial system has a few flaws that need urgent correction. ""There is no doubt that the criminal justice system must reconsider its position and attitude towards laxity and the eventual time it takes to dispose of criminal matters,"" he said, adding that increased application of technology and the strengthening of alternate dispute resolution systems could help cut down the time needed to take cases to their logical conclusion.

Opinion is divided over the killing of four accused in the brutal gang-rape and murder of a veterinarian in Telangana's Shamshabad on November 27. While many -- including Delhi Commission of Women chairperson Swati Maliwal -- claim that the ""encounter killing"" would send out a strong message to sexual predators, others have condemned the manner in which the accused were killed without being given a chance to prove their innocence in court.
The father of another rape victim who was set on fire in Unnao on Thursday has even demanded that the culprits be ""hanged within a week or shot dead"" in a manner similar to the Telangana incident.
Telangana police claim that they killed the four accused because they were trying to escape after snatching their weapons. A petition seeking a probe into the alleged encounter has been filed in the Supreme Court.

The Danger Of Cheering The Telangana Police

December 16th marks seven years since the brutal Delhi gang-rape. Nirbhaya - or ""fearless"" - was the name the young intern was given by an anguished nation for the two weeks she survived after the horrific attack. As she battled for life, an entire country prayed with her family. We prayed for her recovery, we prayed for justice and we prayed that no other woman in India - young or old - would ever go through the kind of violence and trauma this young physiotherapist-to-be had suffered that ordinary December night.  
And we took to the streets. We protested against a broken justice system. We demanded women's safety be made a priority, whether it was the setting up of fast track courts and speedy trials or setting up helplines or improving street lighting and making public transport safer. The Justice Verma Committee was tasked with formulating an urgent set of recommendations that paved the way for the Nirbhaya Act. Passed in 2013, a few months after Nirbhaya died, the Act provided for the most stringent punishments for convicted rapists. It also added a host of other daily violations of women such as stalking to the list of sexual offences.
Just as the Bhanwari Devi rape case in Rajasthan in 1992 resulted in the formulation of the Vishakha Guidelines to protect women from sexual harassment at the workplace, the Nirbhaya gang-rape too was an inflection point in the fight for safety and justice for women in India that led to changes in the law. Seven years and many hundreds of crimes later, the horrific rape and murder of a young vet in Hyderabad is another such moment in time. 
The site where the four men were taken for investigation and later killed when they tried to flee
Once again, the victim, on her way to an appointment who had sought help to replace a flat tyre on her scooter - was raped, asphyxiated and set on fire by her attackers. Once again, the senselessness and brutality of the crime shook the national conscience. Protests demanding accountability from law enforcement, calling out the poor efficiency of fast-track courts and - yet again -  demanding better from Indian men, challenging social attitudes, were held across the country. Melodramatic TV anchors demanding swift action and justice broke down on air, already shrill debates became even more so, and we, the people, began baying for blood. Investigations were virtually done away with, due process thrown into the dustbin. 
If Nirbhaya was an inflection point that made us demand better jurisprudence, the Hyderabad rape has brought out into the open our worst, primal desire for vigilante justice. The triumphalism around the Telangana police's dawn encounter in which the four accused of this heinous crime were shot dead is evidence of a far deeper social malaise in which political expediency and public sentiment determine support or opposition for patently extra-judicial acts by the police. As abhorrent a crime as it was, as deeply as we hold the desire for swift justice, there can be no substitute in the Democratic Republic of India for the rule of law. Those who defend this encounter must realize this is a slippery slope. Our descent into a 'mobocracy' has been steady - whether it is in the instance of techies accused of being child killers by villagers in Karnataka, or a tea-estate manager who was killed by rampaging employees in Assam, or of Muslim and Dalit cattle traders lynched for their trade in Rajasthan and Jharkhand, the mob is delivering its own brand of justice with those it doesn't like or agree with. 
The site where the four men were killed by the police
Those who argue that this is not the first time such 'encounter killings' have happened are right - from 'suspected' terrorists across India's many insurgencies to custodial deaths of under-trials in jails, or of reportedly armed criminals trying to escape, India's criminal justice system is replete with examples of the abuse of power when it comes to the delivery of justice. This time, it is public triumphalism which sets the past apart. The cheering around the Telangana encounter by senior politicians across political parties by police officers and bureaucrats, by industry leaders, and social media influencers, reflects a terrifying, general willingness to bypass the law. But when those tasked with upholding and enforcing the law abuse their power or privilege to serve bloodlust, they give the mob a free pass.
Violence against women shakes us in ways that many other crimes often don't. The vulnerability of the victim, the brutality of the crime, the helplessness of the families who fight for justice create a potent mix of emotions - anger, guilt, fear. We pledge never to let this happen again, until the next time it does, and then we go through the cycle once again. The day before the Telangana police encounter, those seeking swift justice for rape survivors were reacting to another horror. A woman who survived rape in December 2018 in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh, was on her way to testify in court when she was set ablaze by five men, including two of those charged with the crime. She ran - a ball of fire, said an eyewitness - for a kilometre before someone called the police and battled for her life in Delhi before she passed away. Who will answer to her family? There are enough who say given the extremity of these crimes, why not cheer the Telangana police for its action? After all, don't the guilty deserve swift and extreme punishment? 
Protests against the December 16 rape case in 2012
Whether it is these cases today or of Nirbhaya seven years ago, or of journalist Soumya Vishwanathan shot and killed while driving home from work on late night in Delhi in 2008, or Mumbai lawyer Pallavi Purkayastha murdered by a building watchman who felt rejected by her in 2012, each time such crimes take place we react with horror. We demand justice, we demand change. However, each time the demands for better investigations and swifter justice remained within the framework of law and of the democratic, constitutional right to a fair trial - for both the victim and the accused. The Hyderabad case should be no different.
Instead of being riven with bloodlust and cheering the Telangana police for the encounter, perhaps we would be better off as a society to realize that vigilante justice - arbitrary, emotive, egged on by 'public sentiment'- cannot replace the law. When men in uniform are lauded for doing exactly what the mob is condemned for, we legitimize vigilantism. We legitimize the mob. In doing so, we have already entered an era of darkness. Those cheering today must remember we cannot condemn one kind of vigilantism and celebrate another. That is not justice. It is hypocrisy.

Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has blamed the UP government for not providing security to the Unnao woman.
Lucknow:
Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra today blamed the Uttar Pradesh government for not providing security to the Unnao woman, who died at a hospital in Delhi during treatment for burn injuries she suffered after she was set on fire by men accused of raping her, despite a similar incident taking place earlier in the same district. In a tweet, she said: ""Why the victim of Unnao gangrape case was not given security keeping in mind an earlier incident of Unnao? What action has been taken on the police official who refused to register an FIR? What steps are being taken by the government to stop crime against the women, which take place on a daily basis?""
She was referring to another such alleged attack in the district in July when the car in which a woman, who had accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar of raping her, was hit by a truck.
In another tweet Priyanka Gandhi said: ""I pray to God to give courage to the family members of Unnao victim.""
The Congress general secretary also went on to say that it is everyone's collective failure as a society that the woman was not able to get justice. ""At the social level, we all are guilty, but at the same time, this also points out to the hollow law and order mechanism in UP,"" she tweeted.

Yogi Adityanath said the case of the Unnao woman being set on fire will be heard in a fast-track court.
Lucknow:
The case of the woman in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao district, who was set on fire by men accused of raping her, will be heard by a fast-track court, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said today. The 23-year-old woman died of her burn injuries at a hospital in Delhi late last night. Amid nationwide outrage over the incident and the larger issue of women's safety, the Chief Minister also asked two of his ministers to travel to Unnao, 65 km from state capital Lucknow, and meet the woman's family. 
Yogi Adityanath said he is ""extremely saddened to hear of the woman's death"". ""The case will be heard in a fast-track court and strictest of punishment will be given to the culprits,"" the Chief Minister said in a statement.
Two Uttar Pradesh ministers - Kamal Rani Varun and Swami Prasad Maurya - were instructed by Yogi Adityanath to leave for Unnao and meet the woman's family.
The woman, who had suffered 90 per cent burns after she was set on fire on Thursday, died of a cardiac arrest at the Safdarjung Hospital at 11:40 pm, where she had been air-lifted to from Uttar Pradesh on Thursday evening.
The woman's body was transferred to the hospital's forensic department where an autopsy was conducted. Her body is being taken from Delhi to her village in Unnao, 506 km away, by road. The autopsy reports will be given to the police, hospital sources said.
""All I want from the government and the authorities is that either they should be hanged or they should be shot dead, like what happened near Hyderabad. I am not greedy. I don't want any house to be made. I don't want anything else,"" the woman's father told reporters. Her brother said she told him she wanted ""to see the men dead"".
After the Unnao incident, opposition parties targeted the state government over women's safety. While Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra met the woman's family in Unnao, the Samajwadi Party's Akhilesh Yadav sat on a protest outside the UP assembly. Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati too trained her guns at the BJP government in the state and said ""not a single day goes by without a case of crime against women in Uttar Pradesh.""
The woman was on her way to board a train to Rae Bareli to attend a court hearing in the rape case when she was doused with kerosene and set on fire on Thursday, according to the police.
She had filed a complaint with Unnao police in March alleging that she had been raped at gun-point on December 12, 2018, police documents showed. Having been subsequently jailed, the alleged rapist - Shivam Trivedi - was released last week after securing bail, police officer SK Bhagat said. He and his co-accused Shubham Trivedi are among the five attackers.
All five men were arrested from their homes.
""We will appeal to the concerned court today to take this case to fast track court. We will also appeal to hear the case on a day to day basis,"" Uttar Pradesh Justice Minister Brajesh Pathak said.
The circumstances in which the woman's rapist was released on bail are being questioned. So is the role of the police, who filed an FIR on her rape complaint in March, four months after she was allegedly gang-raped by the two men.

Unnao case: The woman suffered 90 per cent burns after she was set on fire on Thursday
New Delhi:
The father of a 23-year-old woman from Uttar Pradesh's Unnao, who died at a hospital in Delhi during treatment for burn injuries she suffered after she was set on fire by men accused of raping her, has said he wants the accused to be ""shot dead"", referring to the killing of four rape accused by the police in Telangana on Friday.
""All I want from the government and the authorities is that either they should be hanged or they should be shot dead, like what happened near Hyderabad. I am not greedy. I don't want any house to be made. I don't want anything else,"" the father told reporters.
""My daughter was travelling alone, going to Raebareli to catch a train,"" he said.
The woman's brother said she told him she wanted ""to see the men dead"". ""My sister said, 'please save me, I want to see them dead'. I said we will save you. But we couldn't. My sister is no more and I also want these five people should not live. That's all what we wish for,"" the brother said.
The woman who suffered 90 per cent burns after she was set on fire on Thursday died of a cardiac arrest at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital last night. She was air-lifted to from Uttar Pradesh on Thursday evening.
""She suffered a cardiac arrest at 11:10 pm. We tried to resuscitate her, but she could not be saved. She died at 11:40 pm,"" said Dr Shalabh Kumar, Head of Department (Burns and Plastic), Safdarjung Hospital.
The woman had told the police she was thrashed and stabbed before being set on fire near her village in Unnao by five men, including two she had accused of raping her and their fathers. She was on her way to a court hearing in her rape complaint when the men surrounded her near a railway station.
The woman, in her burnt state, was conscious all the way to the hospital, where she gave a statement to the police identifying all five attackers.
""At 4 am I was going to a local railway station to catch a train to Rae Bareli. Five people (she named them) were waiting for me. They surrounded me and first hit me on the leg with a stick and also stabbed me in the neck with a knife. After that they poured petrol on me and set me on fire,"" the woman told the police from her hospital bed in Unnao.
Her alleged rapist Shivam Trivedi, who was among the attackers, had been released on bail in the case five days ago. His co-accused Shubham Trivedi, who had been missing, also participated in the attack. All five attackers were arrested from their homes.
The circumstances in which the woman's rapist was released on bail are being questioned. So is the role of the police, who filed an FIR on her rape complaint in March, four months after she was allegedly gang-raped by Shivam Trivedi and his neighbor Subham Trivedi.

""If people have any humanity, then they will feel sad about the Unnao incident. Despite having law and order, we are unable to find a solution to curb violence against women. Why are stringent steps not being taken to prevent such incidents from taking place in the country?"" asked the Congress leader, reported news agency ANI.

Hyderabad Rape Case: The police said the four accused tried to escape from the crime scene
Hyderabad:
The parents of Nirbhaya, whose gang-rape and murder in December 2012 in Delhi shook the nation, have congratulated the Telangana Police after the force claimed they shot dead four accused in the gang-rape and murder of a veterinarian.
The four accused were taken to the spot off a highway near Hyderabad, where they allegedly burned the body of the 26-year-old veterinarian after committing the crime last week, to reconstruct the sequence of events as part of the investigation, the police said.
The police said the accused tried to escape. Reports said the accused even tried to snatch the weapons of the policemen, following which they were shot dead.
""I would like to thank the police. I am very happy with the kind of punishment they have got. The police have set an example. The police have done a very good job. There should be no action against the police. Criminals need to be scared of the police. We need this kind of punishment for criminals these days,"" Nirbhaya's mother Asha Devi told news agency ANI.
""For seven years I have been waiting, going from court to court, making rounds of lower court asking to hang them, but the court said they also have human rights, can't hang them. But it's needed today,"" Asha Devi said. ""Something has changed today with the action by the Telangana Police. I am very happy,"" she added.
Nirbhaya's father Badrinath Singh said, ""Am happy with the encounter because our daughter's rapist is still alive and we die everyday. At least the parents of the Telangana woman won't have to go through this... It would have been worse for the Telangana Police if the accused had escaped. They did a good job.""
On November 27, the men, all truck-drivers and cleaners, saw the veterinarian park her scooter near a toll-booth. She left for a dermatology appointment. They allegedly punctured a tyre of the scooter and had drinks while waiting for her. When she returned, they pretended to help, gang-raped her at a deserted spot, strangled her and burnt her body to destroy evidence, according to the police.
The woman's father told news agency ANI: ""It has been 10 days to the day my daughter died. I express my gratitude towards the police and the government for this. My daughter's soul must be at peace now.""
Amid spiralling outrage, the Telangana Law Department had approved a fast-track court to try the case.
A former police officer controversially suggested public anger had left the police with little choice. ""Although it's totally unprofessional, but I think this was what was expected. I knew something like this was going to happen,"" said Swaranjit Sen, a former Director General of Police, Andhra Pradesh.
Others spoke against instant justice. ""Rape is an heinous crime. It must be dealt with strictly under the provisions of law. While I hold no brief for the alleged perpetrators of this dastardly act, 'encounter' killings are a blot to our system. While I understand the urge for instant justice, this is not the way,"" Congress MP Karti Chidambaram tweeted.

In March, the woman had filed a first information report against two men.
Lucknow:
A 23-year-old woman, set on fire on Thursday morning by the men she had accused of rape, walked nearly a kilometer screaming for help before a witness saw her and called the police in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao. The woman was on her way to a local court for a hearing on her rape case when just outside her village, five men poured kerosene on her and set her on fire.
After dialing the emergency 112 helpline, the witness held his mobile phone on speaker so that the badly burnt woman could speak to the police.
She suffered 90 per cent burns and is critical. She was air-lifted to Delhi later in the evening, and then a green corridor was provided to her ambulance from the airport to the Safdarjung Hospital, helping her cover 13 kilometres in just 18 minutes.
The incident has horrified the nation just days after the rape and murder of a young veterinarian in Telangana, which has led to calls for tough and quick punishment of four accused men.  
The woman's five attackers included the two men she had accused of raping her, said the police. One of them had been missing and the other was released on bail last week.
""We saw her coming towards us, screaming for help. She had been set on fire. We were scared. She had walked for nearly one km before she reached us,"" one of the eyewitnesses who called for help told reporters. She was rushed to a specialised hospital in Lucknow.
In the evening, she was shifted to Delhi's Safdarjung hospital. A green corridor had been created in Lucknow to move her from the hospital to the airport for the flight to Delhi.
In March, the woman had filed a first information report against two men, who are from her father's village in Unnao, accusing them of raping her and filming the act. The FIR was filed in the neighbouring Rae Bareli district reportedly after the intervention of a local court.
""In her FIR, the woman said that one of the two accused was in a relationship with her in 2018 but he physically exploited her, lured her with a marriage proposal. Later, he refused to get married and raped her with another friend,"" said SK Bhagat, senior police officer from Lucknow.  
""One of the accused was sent to jail. He was released on bail on November 30. The two men set the 23-year-old afire to take revenge,"" he added. The police claim to catch the other accused, who had been on the run, they had seized his property and put out lookout notices against him.
Amid attacks by the opposition parties over the incident, the state government has told the police to ensure ""maximum punishment"" for the accused. UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has also sought a report from the state police and has promised to fund the woman's treatment.
UP Director General of Police OP Singh told NDTV: ""Our first priority is to save the woman. The criminal justice system has three-four compartments but we do not work like that. I do not want to blame anyone. The fact is that we did arrest one of the accused. I will get more facts on the case but I am sure that the local police would have opposed the bail application of the rape-accused.""  
The incident has prompted sharp attacks on the state's ruling BJP. In a tweet, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi said the BJP ""should stop spreading false propaganda"". ""Yesterday, the home minister of the country and the Uttar Pradesh chief minister clearly lied that law and order in Uttar Pradesh has improved. Seeing such incidents everyday angers the mind. BJP leaders should stop spreading false propaganda,"" Ms Gandhi wrote in Hindi.
The Nationalist Congress Party's Supriya Sule also commented on the incident in a series of tweets. ""Extremely sad and shocked to hear that that Unnao Rape victim was burnt earlier this morning. If the culprits were not shielded and prosecuted on time this wouldn't have happened. Complete state of Lawlessness in the state of Uttar Pradesh...."" she wrote.
@PMOIndia - The Central government speaks about - 'Beti Bachao - Beti Padhao', however, this seems to be a mere slogan if the daughters of our Nation are not protected.. (3/3)
— Supriya Sule (@supriya_sule) December 5, 2019
Rajya Sabha MP and Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav said: ""President's rule should be imposed in UP where Jungle Raj is prevalent. There is no law and order in the state.""
Unnao BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj said the incident was ""unfortunate"". ""The Unnao incident is really unfortunate. I have used all my power so that the investigation is done and the accused get punishment. The accused in such heinous crimes should get capital punishment,"" he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

President Ram Nath Kovind To Decide On Delhi Appeal Against Nirbhaya Convict's Mercy Plea

President Ram Nath Kovind will take a final call on the matter.
New Delhi:
The centre today confirmed that it has received the Arvind Kejriwal government's recommendation against the mercy plea of a convict in the 2012 Delhi gangrape case, and said that the document will be examined on merit before being sent to President Ram Nath Kovind.
""The file rejecting the mercy plea was forwarded by Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to the Home Ministry,"" a senior functionary in the Home Ministry told NDTV. President Kovind will have the final word on the matter, he added.
Vinay Sharma, one of the four convicts sentenced to death for the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedical student on a moving bus on December 16, 2012, had filed the mercy petition before President Kovind. The woman, now widely known as ""Nirbhaya"", had died of her injuries days after the brutal assault. The incident led to massive protests across the nation, with many demanding that the four convicts be executed on priority.
A week ago, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called for the rejection of the mercy petition to set an example for others who may feel inclined to commit such a crime in the future. ""I think strict action should be taken in such cases, so that people think 10 times before doing something like this. This is why the Delhi government recommended that the President should not show any leniency in this case,"" he told reporters.
The Chief Minister also expressed regret over the delay in executing the convicts' death sentence, a grievance expressed repeatedly by the rape victim's family for many years now. ""There is no shortfall in our laws, the problem lies with those who implement them. Even in our case, delays happened due to those in the administration,"" Badrinath Singh, her father, told NDTV a few days ago.
The National Commission for Women also urged President Kovind to reject the mercy petition, saying that only the death sentence would deter others from committing such crimes against women and girls.
Incidentally, the Delhi government's rejection of the mercy plea comes at a time of nationwide outrage over the gang rape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinarian near Hyderabad. Four people have been arrested in connection with the incident, which occurred on November 27.

The National Commission for Women (NCW) has urged President Ram Nath Kovind to reject the mercy petition of the accused in the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case, saying it would deter others from committing such crimes against young girls and women.
Considering the rising incidents of ""inhuman"" tragedies against young girls and women, an exemplary punishment of death sentence should be given to the convicts of such heinous crimes as they do not deserve any mercy, NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma was quoted as saying in a statement by the Commission.
She requested President Kovind to direct the government to set a definite mechanism and timeline for trial and disposal of all appeals, review petitions and curative petitions in such heinous and brutal rape cases, preferably within six months, so that speedy justice can be ensured.

New Delhi:
A day after Delhi government recommended rejecting the mercy petition of a convict in the Nirbhaya gang-rape and murder case, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that strict action should be taken in such cases to set an example.

Mr Kejriwal said that it is saddening that the judicial procedure took so long to conclude.
""There is anger among the people of the country. We have to come together and do our part to tackle this issue. This cannot go on any longer,"" he said.
The Delhi government had, on Sunday, recommended the rejection of the mercy petition of one of the convicts in the gang rape and murder case of a 23-year-old paramedic student on the intervening night of December 16 and 17 in 2012.

Pawan Kumar Gupta is one of the convicted murderers in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case.
New Delhi:
Father of one of the convicted murderer in the Nirbhaya gang rape and murder case has filed a complaint with the Delhi Police against the sole witness in the case.
Hira Lal Gupta, father of convict Pawan Kumar Gupta, in his complaint to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Southwest Delhi and RK Puram police station has said that the eyewitness in the case was a liar and has been making statements in the media after taking money.
Convict Pawan Kumar Gupta is lodged in Jail no. 14 of the Mandoli jail in Delhi.
""I got to know through social media on October 12, 2019 that the friend of Nirbhaya who was made an eyewitness in the case, used to give statements for money,"" the complaint filed by Hira Lal Gupta on November 2, 2019 said.
In his complaint, Gupta has raised questions on the investigation done by the police on the basis of which the accused were convicted.
Gupta's plea mentions two to three senior journalists of a TV channel also as witnesses.
A person who claims to be the former Managing Editor of a channel took to social media a few days ago and said that Nirbhaya's friend and the only eyewitness of the case used to take money before going to any channels to give statements/interviews. He also claims to have done a sting operation of the whole incident.
Though it also raises a question that why the TV channel didn't air the sting operation?
The lawyer of the accused said: ""The sting could have saved my clients. We will ask the Managing Editor to appear in the court along with with the sting operation. The law is same for everyone.""
Gupta said that he has also given the social media clippings with the plea, which will help the police in probing into the matter. He has also revealed the name of the Managing Editor of the channel in his application.
""If this is true that the only witness in the case gave TV interviews for money, then we will resort to every legal method to protect our clients. Why should our clients face the brunt of perjury? How will court trust the witness whose intentions are doubtful?"" Senior Supreme Court lawyer A. P. Singh, who represents three of the four convicted, told IANS on Wednesday.
Station In charge (SHO)) of the R.K. Puram police station Ravindra Malik told IANS on Wednesday: ""Yes we have received the complaint.""
The FIR of the Nirbhaya gang rape case was registered in Vasant Vihar police station, but the application against the eyewitness has been registered at R.K. Puram police station.
""We tried to file the complaint at the Vasant Vihar police station, but the SHO was evasive. Then, we filed the complaint at the office of DCP Devendra Arya,"" Singh told IANS.
Ravi Shankar, SHO Vasant Vihar police station, told IANS: ""They came to me with the complaint but since they live in R. K. Puram so I didn't register the complaint here.""

Besides Kuldeep Sengar, there were 154 undertrials in the lock-up, officials said. (File)
New Delhi:
Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, accused in the Unnao rape case, was lodged in the lock-up at the Tis Hazari court complex in Delhi when the clash between lawyers and police personnel broke out last week, officials said.
Besides Kuldeep Sengar, there were 154 undertrials in the lock-up, they said.
According to a senior police officer, two high-risk undertrials -- Feroz and Javed -- were among those in the lock-up.
Kuldeep Sengar was brought from Tihar Jail, where he is currently lodged, to the lock-up in the court premises on Saturday morning and then produced before the district judge around 10:30 am for a hearing in the case, said a lawyer.
""There was fire in front of the lock-up gate and due to smoke, police personnel and undertial prisoners started to suffocate. The personnel, along with sewadars, threw water on the fire and doused it before it could turn into a big tragedy,"" the police officer said.
Sewadars are the inmates who are lodged in jail for crimes that are not heinous. They accompany undertrial prisoners to courts to serve them jail food.
Kuldeep Sengar had appeared in the courtroom of District Judge Dharmesh Sharma. He was taken out around 7 pm when paramilitary forces arrived, the lawyer said.
He returned to the jail premises around 8 pm, he said.
A parking dispute between an on-duty policeman and a lawyer had triggered the clash, leaving 20 police personnel and several advocates injured.

A lawyer who is involved in the case said district judge Dharmesh Sharma, during in-camera proceedings, took note of a charge-sheet filed by the CBI in the gang-rape case and put up the matter for further hearing on October 15.
In its charge-sheet, the probe agency named three people - Naresh Tiwari, Brijesh Yadav and Shubham Singh - as accused, and also charged them under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The maximum punishment for the offence is life imprisonment.
Quoting the rape survivor's statement recorded before a judicial magistrate in Unnao, the CBI said on June 11, 2017, she had come out of her house to fetch water at night when Singh and Tiwari, along with three others, pulled her inside a car.
After covering some distance, Singh and Tiwari allegedly raped her in the car, according to the charge-sheet. She was taken to a house on the way to Kanpur where two unknown persons, with muffled faces, allegedly raped her, it said.
After two-three days, she was taken to Yadav's house, where he allegedly raped her. Then two days later, she was taken to Auraiya district in Uttar Pradesh from where she was recovered by the police, the charge-sheet said.
The CBI said further investigation is going on in the case regarding the role of the other accused. The probe agency has named 103 witnesses to be examined in the case which has been transferred to Delhi on the orders of the Supreme Court.

New Delhi:
The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) Thursday sought seven days from a city court for providing accommodation to the family of the Unnao rape survivor, who was allegedly raped by expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in 2017.

The DCW told District Judge Dharmesh Sharma during an in-camera proceedings that they have identified few residential houses for the family and the security personnel but needed some time to finalise the deal, a lawyer privy to the matter said.
The court directed the Superintendent of the Jay Prakash Narayan Trauma Centre, AIIMS, Delhi to accommodate the rape survivor and her family at the hostel where they are currently lodged, till further orders, the lawyer said.
The court had earlier asked DCW chairperson to nominate a team of two counsellors to assess their residential requirements and assist them in finding accommodation after the counsel for the rape survivor told the court that landlords were unwilling to give their premises on rent to them for a short duration and due to the background of the case.
The court had said the team would assist them in locating and providing suitable place in Delhi at a reasonable rate of rent or in any government accommodation for at least 11 months, he said.
The rape survivor's family had earlier told the court that they wanted to reside in the national capital apprehending threat in Uttar Pradesh, their native state.
The woman was brought to AIIMS after an accident on July 28, following the Supreme Court's orders. The family is under CRPF security.
The court had earlier framed charges against the MLA for allegedly kidnapping and raping the woman in Unnao in 2017, when she was a minor.
The rape survivor's father was arrested on April 3, 2018 in a case by the police under the Arms Act. He died in judicial custody six days later.

BJP leader Chinmayanand faces rape allegations from a law student in Uttar Pradesh
New Delhi:
The allegation of rape by a law student in Uttar Pradesh against senior BJP leader and former union minister Chinmayanand will be investigated thoroughly, sources in the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that's probing the rape allegation said.
""It's incorrect to say we won't investigate Chinmayanand. We summoned him three days ago to appear for questioning, but we were told there are some health reasons. We hope to interrogate him in the next few days,"" the sources said.
The law student has alleged that she was filmed, blackmailed and raped repeatedly by Chinmayanand, who has not been questioned by the police so far. No complaint has been registered against the politician either.
The BJP leader's lawyer, Om Singh, however, said the allegation is a conspiracy against his client. ""They (SIT) did issue a summon four days ago, but one of their officers went out of town and they recalled it. They said they would call Chinmayanand again. Whenever the SIT calls him, he will appear and reply to all questions. He is not unwell, not hiding. He is at his ashram, at his home,"" Mr Singh said.
Sources say in a statement to the Delhi Police and magistrate, the 23-year-old woman has described what she alleges was a year of sexual assault by the politician, who runs several ashrams and educational institutions.
""Media reports say we interrogated the girl for over 11 hours. That's not true. We spoke to her father for about five hours and then the girl (accompanied by her father) for another four-five hours. We are treating her as a victim and we did not interrogate her, but tried to help her to plug any loopholes in her statement,"" said a police officer of the special team, who asked not to be named.
She has reportedly repeated the allegations before a Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT), which has questioned her for some 15 hours and has seen videos given by the woman.
""We are aware of the videos that are viral on WhatApp, and are also aware of the girl's complaint against Chinmayanand. We will definitely question him and take all other action that may be required. We have to submit a status report to the Allahabad High Court on September 23,"" the police officer said.
In her 12-page complaint, say sources, the woman has said she first met Chinmayanand, 73, in June last year for admission in a law course at a college in Shahjahanpur he runs. She alleges that he took her phone number and arranged her admission. He allegedly called her and also offered her a job at the college library for a salary of Rs 5,000.
She says she worked alongside her classes since her family was poor.
Chinmayanand allegedly asked the woman to move into the hostel in October and later invited her to his ashram. The woman claims he showed her a video of her bathing in the hostel, threatened to ""make it viral"" and forced himself on her. The politician allegedly also filmed the rape and used it for blackmail.
The woman alleges she was forced to give him massages and often, brought to him by his aides at gunpoint. The alleged assaults continued until in July this year, the woman decided to make videos as proof against Chinmayanand.

Unnao case: Former BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar has been accused of rape by a teen
New Delhi:
A judge went to Delhi's AIIMS hospital today to record the statement of a teen who was allegedly raped by politician Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a former BJP MLA who is also accused of plotting a car crash that left the survivor in a critical state.
The rape-accused MLA was also taken to the hospital ""courtroom"" set up at a trauma centre seminar hall for the hearing. To ensure that the rape survivor did not come face to face with him, a curtain separated the two during the teen's testimony.
The teen from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh has been in hospital since July, after a truck crashed into the car she was travelling in, killing two of her aunts.
Last week, the Delhi High Court had ordered the special court at AIIMS or the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in what has been dubbed the Unnao rape case. This would help the rape survivor to testify in hospital, the court said, putting out strict instructions including that she be brought on a stretcher or trolley and placed in a way that she faced the judge during the closed hearing, and that an experienced nurse be by her side. The hospital has also been asked to switch off CCTVs at the hearing.
The High Court acted after being asked by the Supreme Court to decide on a lower court judge's request for a special hearing at AIIMS.
The teen was travelling from her hometown Unnao to Raebareli when the car was hit by a speeding truck with its number plate blackened
The top court also granted more time to the CBI to complete its investigation into the July 28 car crash, which, the survivor's family alleges, was plotted by Sengar to eliminate her and escape the charges.
The teen was travelling from her hometown Unnao to Raebareli when the car was hit by a speeding truck with its number plate blackened. The girl and her lawyer were critically injured in the incident.
On August 1, the Supreme Court shifted the five cases connected with the Unnao rape case to Delhi, assigned a special judge for day-to-day trial and ordered that the trial be completed within 45 days. The court also ordered central security for the family.
The court had stepped in after a letter from the girl's family alleging threats from Kuldeep Sengar's aides. The family, in a letter to Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on July 12, alleged grave danger to them from Sengar and his aides. The family had asked for protection, alleging that they had been harassed and intimidated over the past year and pressured to drop the case.
The teen was moved from a hospital in Raebareli to AIIMS last month; she is being treated by a multidisciplinary team from the critical care, orthopaedics, trauma surgery and pulmonary medicine departments.
Sengar has been in jail since April last year. After the road accident, the rape survivor's family named Sengar in their First Information Report.
The case is seen as an example of egregious abuse of power by a politician who was apparently given a long rope by the administration led by his party.
Kuldeep Sengar, a four-time BJP lawmaker, was suspended after his arrest. As fresh allegations emerged against him, the BJP expelled him amid growing criticism about its reluctance to act against the politician.

Chinmayanand is an influential politician and owns an ashram and five colleges in Shahjahanpur
New Delhi:
The UP college student who accused BJP leader and former Union Minister Chinmayanand of rape was today taken to her hostel room in Shahjahanpur district by members of a Supreme Court-constituted SIT, in the presence of a magistrate, to gather evidence in the case. The young woman, who last month went missing for a week because she feared for her life, has alleged the former BJP MP ""raped and even exploited me physically for one year"" and that she and her family had received threats from the accused, the UP Police and the Shahjahanpur district administration.
The 23-year-old, who is a law student at a college run by Chinmayanand, 72, submitted a 12-page document to Delhi Police on Thursday, declaring she had lost faith in their UP counterparts' ability to protect her and deliver justice. Delhi Police have handed over the complaint to the SIT.
""I have no problem answering questions but at least arrest the accused. I was running for days, trying to save myself. The Shahjahanpur DM threatened my father, he warned him to think about who the case was being filed against. There is a threat from UP police,"" she told reporters earlier this week while wearing a black scarf across her face to protect her identity.
She had also said she would provide evidence to back her allegations ""at the right time"" and that ""the evidence is safe in my hostel room"".
The young woman went missing on August 24, a day after she posted a video accusing Chinmayanand of sexual harassment and calling on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for help. She was traced to Rajasthan and brought before the Supreme Court, where she told judges she had left to protect herself. The top court ordered a Special Investigation Team (SIT), which began work on September 3, to inquire into her allegations.
""He raped me, sexually exploited me. I have told the SIT everything. A girl raped for a year is questioned for 11 hours,"" the woman said on Monday.
Chinmayanand has declared he has ""full faith in the judiciary"" and his lawyer called the woman's rape claims ""new drama"".
""On August 24 she made the first video... she didn't say something had happened to her. She alleged he (Chinmayanand) had destroyed lives of many girls and (was) threatening her... when she was not successful in her conspiracy, she created new drama,"" Om Singh, Chinmayanand's lawyer said.
Although the woman did not name Chinmayanand at the time of initial allegations, her father named the influential politician in his complaint. As the case became public, he was charged with kidnapping and intimidation.
His lawyer has denied claims he has been trying to avoid the police. ""Swami is not running away from the case. He is engaged in spiritual activities, but will definitely appear before the Delhi Police whenever required,"" news agency ANI quoted his lawyer as saying.
Chinmayanand, said to be a powerful politician, has an ashram in Shahjahanpur and runs five colleges in the town. He also runs ashrams in Hardwar and Rishikesh; his empire is believed to be worth crores though there is no official estimate.

BJP leader Chinmayanand has been accused of rape by a student in Uttar Pradesh
New Delhi:
BJP leader and former union minister Chinmayanand has been accused of rape by a young woman who went missing for a week from her home in Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh and was found in Rajasthan. In a complaint to the police, the law student has claimed that she was raped and exploited by Chinmayanand for a year.
The woman, 23, is a student at a law college run by 72-year-old Chinmayanand, a three-time MP. Her brother also studies there.
She said she had filed her complaint in Delhi because the UP police had refused to do so.
""Swami Chinmayanand raped me and even exploited me physically for one year,"" she alleged before the media, her face covered with a black scarf.
""The Delhi Police has registered this complaint at Lodhi Road police station and has forwarded it to Shahjahanpur police, which is not registering the rape case,"" she said.
The Supreme Court had heard the woman's account in a closed hearing and ordered a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to inquire into her allegations. ""On Sunday, the SIT quizzed me for about 11 hours. I have told them about the rape. Even after I told them everything, they haven't arrested Chinmayanand yet,"" she said.
The woman was tracked down in Rajasthan on August 30, a week after she vanished following her Facebook post alleging that a ""big leader of the Sant Samaj"" had ""destroyed the lives of many other girls and also has threatened to kill me"". In the post, she had requested Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to help her.
Though she didn't name Chinmayanand at the time, her father named the influential politician and named him in his complaint to the police. As the case became public and made waves on social media, the former BJP MP was charged with kidnapping and intimidation three days after the woman's father approached the UP police.
The woman was produced before the Supreme Court hours after she was found. She told the judges she had left with her college friends to protect herself. Ordering an investigation, the court said she and her brother couldn't possibly study in Chinmayanand's institution anymore.
Chinmayanand's lawyer has denied claims that he has been trying to avoid the police. ""Swami is not running away from the case. He is currently engaged in spiritual activities, but will definitely appear before the Delhi Police whenever required,"" news agency ANI quoted advocate Om Singh as saying on September 2.
Chinmayanand, said to be a powerful politician, has an Ashram in Shahjahanpur and runs five colleges in the town. He also runs Ashrams in Hardwar and Rishikesh; his empire is believed to be worth crores though there is no official estimate.

A trial court in Delhi has asked the High Court for permission to record the Unnao survivor's rape.
New Delhi:
A special court in Delhi today sought the High Court's permission to record the Unnao rape survivor's statement after doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) advised against taking her to the court premises.
District judge Dharmesh Sharma told the court that though the CBI, the rape survivor and her family have ""no objection"" to such deposition, the lawyers for the accused-expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar-opposed it.
The Delhi High court was hearing the case of alleged kidnapping and rape of the woman in 2017. She is being treated at AIIMS after an accident in July.
Senior Public Prosecutor Ashok Bhartendu said considering the medical condition of the rape survivor, it was not advisable to bring her to court premises.
The Unnao rape survivor's mother and lawyer Dharmendra Mishra also said that there were certain injuries which might make it difficult for her to appear before the court.
However, advocate Tanveer Ahmed Mir, appearing for Kuldeep Singh Sengar, told the court that he would give consent for such deposition unless he is sure that the woman has proper cognitive faculties to understand the questions asked.
""We urge that the medical status of the survivor be ascertained. It should not lead to a situation where the defence feels helpless in case the victim is unable to understand the questions put to her.""
After the lawyer's argument, the court asked the CBI for the survivor's medical report. The CBI told the court that doctors attending to her believe she is out of danger.
""She is fit for statement. Regarding deposition for long hours in the court, it is not advisable to bring her to the court premises. The deposition of the survivor can be done from the hospital premises if deemed fit by the court,"" the medical report submitted by AIIMS stated.
The rape survivor's lawyer opposed the suggestion, saying that the trial must not be shifted to the hospital.

NEW DELHI:
A Delhi court today recorded the statement of the Unnao rape survivor's relative in the case in which expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar is a key accused.
District Judge Dharmesh Sharma was presiding over the in-camera hearing in the 2017 case of alleged kidnapping and sexual assault of the woman by the MLA.
An uncle of the Unnao rape survivor, who has been convicted in a 19-year-old case and sentenced to 10-year jail term on a case filed by Kuldeep Sengar's brother Atul Singh, had been transferred to the Tihar jail in Delhi from a prison in Uttar Pradesh to ensure his safety.
The recording of the statement remained inconclusive and will continue on September 2.
The Supreme Court had transferred four criminal cases from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi -- the 2017 rape case; an alleged fake matter under the Arms Act against the father of the rape survivor; his death in police custody, and the gang rape of the woman.
The court had earlier directed the media to abstain from reporting names and addresses of the rape survivor, her family and witnesses and certain other aspects of the case.
The court on August 9 framed charges against Kuldeep Sengar for allegedly kidnapping and raping the woman. It had also framed charges against Atul Singh for allegedly taking her to Kuldeep Sengar's house on June 4, 2017 without the consent of her parents with the knowledge that she would be subjected to rape.
Both the accused, had however, denied the allegations, saying they have been falsely implicated in the case.

All the three accused in this case are out on bail.
The court had earlier declined the plea of CBI seeking 30 days to complete the investigation and directed it to file a status report by August 17.
The woman, who was a minor then, was allegedly raped by Kuldeep Sengar on June 4, 2017 and the three other men on June 11, 2017.
The woman is critical and admitted at AIIMS hospital in New Delhi after a truck rammed into the car in which she was was travelling along with some family members and her lawyer on July 28. Two of her aunts died in the accident.

Kuldeep Singh Sengar was expelled by the BJP over rape allegations. (PTI)
New Delhi:
The counsel for the Unnao rape survivor told a court in Delhi today that the CBI did not deliberately name expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his brother as accused in her father's killing.
Appearing for the CBI, Senior Public Prosecutor Ashok Bhartendu denied the allegation and said the investigation officer collected the evidence in the case in all ""fairness"" and there was no ""mala fide"" intention on his part.
The court reserved its order on framing of charges for August 13 in the case of alleged assault and framing of the rape survivor's father in an Arms Act case in 2018.
Ten people, including Kuldeep Sengar, his brother Atul Singh Sengar and three police officers have been named as accused in the CBI chargesheet.
During the day, the murder case of the teen survivor's father also came up before the court. Kuldeep Sengar and his brother have not been named as accused by the CBI in this case. The CBI said though the chargesheet had been filed in the murder case, the probe was still going on.
""It cannot be said that the IO deliberately did not name the MLA and his brother Atul Singh Sengar as accused in the case and supported the accused. Evidence was collected in all fairness. There was no mala fide intention on his part,"" Mr Bhartendu said.
""Till now, the CBI did not find anything against the MLA to be a common accused. If, during the trial, the agency finds any evidence against the duo, a supplementary chargesheet will be filed,"" the public prosecutor said.
The counsel for the rape survivor and her family -- advocates Dharmendra Mishra and Poonam Kaushik -- alleged that the investigating officer did not probe the case properly.
""The father was allegedly beaten up badly and due to his injuries, he died in judicial custody. The IO deliberately filed two different chargesheets -- one in the case of assaulting and framing of false charges and the other in the murder case,"" Mr Mishra said.
He also alleged that the MLA and his brother, along with their ""accomplices"", had assaulted the 19-year-old rape survivor's father and filed a false complaint against him.
""The unnatural death of the father was due to the fact that he was badly beaten up and was not given proper medical care in custody. Hence, the role of the Sengars should be investigated,"" the counsel said.
During the proceedings, the court was also informed by the IO that ""satisfactory"" boarding and lodging arrangements were made for the rape survivor''s mother and other family members.
""I find that satisfactory arrangements have been made for the boarding and lodging and three times'' meals as also the security of the mother and other family members of the survivor and they have been provided four rooms, three on one floor and one on the other floor...efforts are being made to accommodate them on the same floor to avoid any inconvenience to them,"" the judge said.
The CBI had earlier told the court that the MLA and his ""accomplices"" had allegedly assaulted and framed the rape survivor's father in a case of illegal firearms possession.

Charges said Kuldeep Singh Sengar threatened the survivor to not disclose the incident to anyone (File)
New Delhi:
The CBI has told a Delhi court that Uttar Pradesh Police was ""lackadaisical"" in handling the 2017 case of a minor girl who was raped in Unnao allegedly by MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.
In its charges filed on July 11, 2018, the probe agency said they were investigating the role of authorities of the district administration and medical hospitals in Unnao district.
""During investigation, action taken by local police on several complaints on the incidents were also collected which showed lackadaisical approach of local thana police and supervisory police officers,"" the charge sheet said.
The CBI added that further investigation was going on in this matter.
Sengar's accomplice Shashi Singh has also been named as an accused in the charge sheet for allegedly luring the minor into going to the legislator's residence.
The accused have been charged for the offences under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
According to the charges, on June 4, 2017, Shashi Singh had taken the girl to Sengar's residence on the pretext of getting her a job and the MLA allegedly raped her.
It said Sengar had threatened the survivor to not disclose the incident to anyone.
The charges further said though the girl tried to report the incident, no action was taken ""under the influence"" of Sengar.
It stated that the father of the survivor was ""brutally beaten up badly by Sengar's brother Atul Singh Sengar and his henchmen"" on April 3, 2018 ""in public view for creating terror"".
He was arrested and falsely implicated in a case of illegal firearms possession, the CBI has claimed in another charge sheet filed in the case. He died in judicial custody on April 9, 2018.
The Dirst Information Report or FIR was lodged in the case at Makhi police station, against Sengar and Singh on April 12, 2018, after the girl had tried to set herself on fire in front of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence.
Armed with the Supreme Court's directive, District Judge Dharmesh Sharma is hearing the Unnao cases on day-to-day basis.
The top court transferred four criminal cases from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi - the 2017 rape case; a fake matter under the Arms Act against the father of the rape survivor; his death in police custody, and the gang rape of the woman.
Kuldeep Singh Sengar was expelled from the BJP last month.

The agency submitted to District Judge Dharmesh Sharma that the MLA and his ""accomplices"", got lodged an FIR, accusing the rape victim's father of possessing a country-made pistol and four live cartridges.
The FIR also accused the victim's father of verbally abusing the MLA's brother Atul Singh Sengar and others involved in the case.
CBI counsel Ashok Bhartendu told the court that the three police officials, accused in the case of assaulting the victim's father, included the then Makhi police station's in-charge Ashok Singh Bhadauria, Sub Inspector Kamta Prasad and Constable Amir Khan.
While Bhadauria and Prasad were out on bail, Amir, who was not arrested in the case, was granted the relief from the arrest by the court today.
The charges, however, were denied by the accused persons, which also included Shailendra Singh, Vineet Mishra, Birendra Singh, Shashi Pratap Singh and Ram Sharan Singh.
According to the CBI, the incident took place on April 3, 2018 following an altercation between the victim's father and Shashi Pratap Singh.
The charge sheet filed on July 13, 2018, said the victim's father and his co-worker were returning to their village, Makhi, when they asked Shashi Pratap Singh to give them a lift up to the village in their vehicle.
Singh, however, denied the lift, triggering an altercation among them.
This prompted Singh to call up his associates, following which MLA's brother Atul Singh Sengar reached the spot along with others and beat up the victim's father and his co-workers.
The victim's father was subsequently taken to the police station by them and an FIR was lodged against him and he was arrested.
The charge sheet said all this while, MLA Kuldeep Singh Senger was in touch with the district police superintendent, police station's in-charge Bhadauria. Later he also talked to the doctor, who examined the victim's father.
""MLA (Kuldeep) has every reason and authority by virtue of his being an MLA to falsely implicate the (victim's) father in the case of illegal fire arms possession,"" the CBI said.
The rape victim's father died in judicial custody on April 9, 2018.
The counsel for the rape victim and her family, advocates Dharmendra Mishra and Poonam Kaushik, told the court that charge should also be framed against the chief medical officer of Unnao's district hospital.
The court adjourned the case for next hearing on August 10.

Unnao rape case: The ambulance covered a distance of 33 km in just 39 minutes in Lucknow
Lucknow:
On Monday evening, one side of the six-laned Lohia Path in Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow, a road that passes very close to the residence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, was emptied out by the Lucknow Police for a full hour between 6 and 7 pm. At this time this road sees peak traffic, but on Monday evening there was none.
The road was part of a complex transfer for the Unnao rape survivor from Lucknow's trauma centre to Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences or AIIMS. The end-to-end transfer was achieved in less than three hours, courtesy green corridors or temporary emergency lanes on roads at both Lucknow and Delhi. Green corridors are mostly activated for organ transplants but doctors and policemen say this was an exception.
Videos shot by journalists on Lucknow's Lohia Path showed a police vehicle, its sirens blaring, leading the ambulance on the road, followed by three security vehicles. In Lucknow, the rape survivor's ambulance left the trauma center at the King George's Medical University at 6.24 pm on Monday evening. The ambulance was at the Lucknow airport at 7:03 pm, a record 39 minutes for a 33 km journey that would normally take well over an hour. 
The Lucknow police that organised the green corridor says the ambulance passed through 22 major traffic intersections. 12 senior Lucknow police officers and 142 police constables ensured a traffic free passage for the girl along the 33 km route. The route for the girl's ambulance was not the shortest one, but the one with the best roads. From the Lucknow airport, the girl was flown to the Delhi airport in an air ambulance that was waiting for her.
The one good thing @Uppolice has done for the #Unnao rape survivor .A 33 km green corridor from trauma centre to LKO airport for her transfer to Delhi 's AIIMS .Organised by the @lkopolice .Her ambulance covered the distance in 39 mins on Mon !

The girl's air ambulance landed at Delhi's domestic airport shortly before 9 pm. A road ambulance carrying the girl left the airport at 9 pm and reached the AIIMS Trauma Centre in south Delhi at 9:18 pm, covering about 15 km in 18 minutes using a green corridor like the one created in Lucknow. Under normal circumstances, this journey would take at least 35 minutes, if not more. 
A similar exercise was repeated for the rape survivor's lawyer on Tuesday morning - with identical results. 
The 19-year-old rape survivor, who has accused expelled BJP lawmaker Kuldeep Singh Sengar of raping her at his residence in 2017, was travelling with her advocate and two aunts on July 28 when their car was hit by a speeding truck in Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli district. Two of her aunts - one of whom was a witness to the rape - died in the accident, which many claim was orchestrated by the politician and his brother - Atul - to get back at the rape survivor.

The woman and her lawyer suffered critical injuries on July 28 when their car was hit by a truck in UP.
Lucknow:
The lawyer of the Unnao rape survivor, who suffered critical injuries in a car-truck collision last week, was airlifted to New Delhi on Tuesday following Supreme Court directives in this regard.
""The lawyer was sent to New Delhi special air ambulance. He has left the Lucknow hospital, where he was undergoing treatment to airport from where he will be taken to New Delhi for better treatment,"" District Magistrate said.
According to Lucknow hospital administration, the lawyer was not on ventilator but was still in a serious condition and is in ""coma"".
The rape survivor was on Monday airlifted through an air ambulance.
The woman and her lawyer suffered critical injuries on July 28 when the car, in which they and two others were travelling, was hit by a truck in Raebareli. Two of her relatives were killed in the accident.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which has taken over the probe into the accident, booked 10 people for murder, including BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who is already in jail, charged with the rape of the Unnao woman when she was a minor in 2017.
The top court had directed to shift the injured to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi for better care, as she was still critical.

Unnao Teen, Critical, Won't Be Airlifted To Delhi For Now: Supreme Court

New Delhi:
A teenage girl who was allegedly raped by an expelled BJP lawmaker in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao won't be shifted to Delhi for treatment for injuries she suffered in a road accident on July 28. Her family told the Supreme Court today that they want her treatment to continue at the hospital in Lucknow where she is being treated for serious injuries.
The teenage girl and her family met with an accident in Rae Bareli when the car they were travelling in collided with a truck, whose number plate was scrubbed with black paint. Two of her aunts died. The girl's lawyer, who was also in the vehicle, has been admitted in hospital with injuries. The security detail that the girl was meant to have, was not accompanying her.
The Supreme Court was today hearing whether to airlift the rape survivor from a hospital in Lucknow to AIIMS in Delhi for treatment when her mother said it is not needed for now. The court then said the family is free to take a call on shifting her to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).
""So far as the movement of the victim is concerned since the family wants treatment at Lucknow, we will wait... immediate concern is the health of the victim,"" the Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi said today.
The Supreme Court also told news organisations not to reveal the identity of the rape survivor, after it was pointed out that the media was running old interviews of her.
The Supreme Court today put on hold the transfer of the accident case from Lucknow to Delhi for 15 days. This was done due to jurisdiction issues as the Central Bureau of Investigation may have to get the trial court's permission for interrogation of the accused.
The CBI has sought custodial interrogation of Kuldeep Sengar. A team of the probe agency, along with forensic officers, will reach the accident site at Raebareli today to gather evidence.
The condition of the rape survivor and the lawyer is critical, sources said. The lawyer is off ventilator and is breathing on his own though he still needs oxygen support, they said.
The rape survivor has fever, is still on ventilator and underwent a procedure on Thursday, sources said.
A huge controversy broke over alleged inaction against now-expelled BJP lawmaker Kuldeep Sengar despite the survivor's ordeal - from losing her father in police custody to two aunts dying in a road accident. One of the aunts was also a witness in the rape case.
Kuldeep Sengar was with the Samajwadi Party before he jumped to the BJP ahead of the Uttar Pradesh election in March 2017. The rape took place in June that year, when the girl had gone to his Unnao home to look for a job.
He is in a jail in Uttar Pradesh's Sitapur for more than a year. He used to make calls from inside the prison to threaten the family, said a police complaint filed by the teen's uncle a day after the accident last week. The girl's family alleged the lawmaker had engineered the accident.

The Supreme Court took up the case after a letter by the Unnao teen and her family.
New Delhi:
The Unnao rape survivor must be given central protection and Rs 25 lakh compensation by tomorrow, the Supreme Court said on Thursday in a series of decisions that included the transfer of all five cases linked to the teen's rape allegedly by powerful lawmaker Kuldeep Sengar out of Uttar Pradesh to Delhi. A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi also ordered the CBI to complete within 7 days its investigation into the car crash on Sunday that left the girl critically wounded and killed two of her relatives.
Here are the top 10 updates on the Unnao case:
The teenager is on the ventilator after the car crash on Sunday, when the Swift Dzire she was travelling in was hit by a truck with its number plate painted black. A First Information Report (FIR) lodged a day after the car crash named Kuldeep Sengar, his brother Manoj Singh Sengar and eight others. The case was subsequently transferred to the CBI.
The girl's family has accused Kuldeep Sengar, the four-time lawmaker charged with her rape, of plotting to kill her to try and escape the law.
The ruling BJP, sharply criticized for delaying action against the lawmaker, expelled him on Thursday. A year ago, the party had suspended him when he was arrested and jailed.
The Supreme Court said the CBI's probe into the car crash must be completed in seven days and the trial all five cases, including the rape case, must end within 45 days. More time could be given for the crash investigation if required, the court said.
The teen and her family had written to the Chief Justice alleging grave danger to their lives and threats from the politician and his aides. The court on Thursday said the teenager, her family and her lawyer must be given immediate protection by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).
The Chief Justice had sought a report from the top court registry on the delay in bringing the July 12 letter to his notice.
The teen's letter reportedly related several incidents between July 7 and 8, when some people allegedly associated with Sengar threatened the survivor's family. The letter also requested the court to ask the police to file a case against the people who allegedly tried to intimidate them.
The letter added to growing evidence of delay in investigations and neglect in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, which has earlier faced allegations of going soft on Sengar.
The girl had said that she was sexually assaulted by the politician when she went to his home for a job in 2017.
She went public days after her father was thrashed by Sengar's brother. In a protest outside UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's home, the girl threatened to set herself on fire if the police didn't act on her complaint. A day later, her father, who was arrested in a severely wounded state on charges of carrying weapons, died in custody.

New Delhi:
In a huge embarrassment for the Yogi Adityanath Government, the Supreme Court today transferred all the five cases involving the Unnao rape survivor out of Uttar Pradesh to Delhi. The court also directed the Uttar Pradesh government to pay interim compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the rape survivor by tomorrow. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, also said the CBI probe into the car crash must be completed in seven days and the rape case in 45 days.
The teenager is battling for her life after a car crash on Sunday. The top court also said the CBI's probe into the car crash must be completed in seven days.
Earlier today, the top court had asked the ""responsible"" officer of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to appear before it and give details on the status of rape case and the car crash.The CBI is investigating both the cases. 
A letter by the teen rape survivor and her family to Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi - sent on July 12 - alleging grave danger to them was taken up by the Supreme Court, four days after the girl was critically injured and two of her aunts died in the crash that her family alleges was planned by the man she has accused of rape, jailed lawmaker Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who now has been expelled by the party.
Sengar is accused by the teen of sexually assaulting her when she went to his Unnao home for a job in 2017. He was arrested in April last year, days after the girl threatened to set herself ablaze in front of UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's home in Lucknow if the police didn't file her complaint.

Election Commission has sought a report from the chief electoral officer of Punjab. (File)
New Delhi:
The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has issued a notice to the Election Commission after a district poll panel in Punjab allegedly used the picture of a 2012 Delhi gang-rape convict on a hoarding.
The Election Commission has now sought a report from the chief electoral officer of Punjab on the issue by Tuesday morning, official sources said.
The hoarding was allegedly put up by the Hoshiarpur district election office to encourage people to vote.
On December 16, 2012, six men assaulted and raped a 23-year-old paramedic student in a moving bus in Delhi and a fortnight later, she died at a Singapore hospital.
The girl's mother, Asha Devi, informed the DCW chief Swati Maliwal of the matter and said a picture is being circulated on social media where the photograph of Mukesh Singh, a convict in the rape case, was displayed on official hoardings in Punjab.
Describing the matter as a ""great shame"" and an ""attempt to glorify a rape convict"", Ms Maliwal issued a notice to the EC.
In the notice, she mentioned that this has caused great pain and hurt not only to the parents of the victim but also to all victims of sexual violence.
The DCW sought the strictest of actions in the matter against those responsible for this act and asked the EC to fix accountability of officers.
""The commission has sought the names of the officers responsible for the act and details of the action that has been taken against them.
""The commission has also sought the steps that shall be taken by the Election Commission to ensure such incidents do not occur in the future,"" Ms Maliwal said.
The DCW chairperson said instead of ensuring that the rape convict is given death penalty as ordered by the Supreme Court, government agencies are ""glorifying"" him.
""The convict whose photo has been displayed on advertising boards played a major role in the December 2012 gang rape of Nirbhaya. In fact, he has even been heard stating on record that women invite rape. Is he a model citizen that his photo should be publicised?"" Ms Maliwal said.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh on Saturday for the family of a six-year-old girl who was allegedly raped in Dwarka earlier this week, and said he would meet the city police commissioner over the law-and-order situation in the national capital.
Accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Mr Kejriwal met the girl and her family members at the Safdarjung Hospital.
Announcing financial help, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) supremo said the Delhi government would ensure the best medical facilities for the survivor, who was undergoing treatment at the hospital.
""We will give Rs 10 lakh to the family and get her treated by the best doctors. We will also meet the police commissioner over the law-and-order situation and extend to him whatever cooperation he requires,"" the chief minister told reporters.
A 24-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping the girl in Dwarka on Tuesday.
According to a senior police officer, the survivor was found in the bushes adjacent to a road and rushed to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital.
Later, she was shifted to the Safdarjung Hospital, where her condition was stated to be critical, the officer had said.
The police identified the accused with the help of CCTV footage obtained from the area. The footage showed the accused with the girl on the day of the incident.
The accused was unemployed and lived in the same locality as that of the survivor.
Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) Chairperson Swati Maliwal met the girl and her family members on Friday.
After visiting the survivor at the hospital, the DCW chief said, ""I am shocked to see the condition of the girl. It is horrifying and she has been subjected to extreme cruelty by the accused.""
The survivor hailed from Bihar and was studying in Class 2 in a school in Delhi, Ms Maliwal said that her father was a labourer while her mother worked as a domestic help. The DCW chief also made an appeal seeking financial help for the victim's family. Those willing to come forward for the cause may contact the DCW on the 181 helpline number or by sending an e-mail to livingpositive@gmail.com.
Ms Maliwal also assured the family of financial and legal assistance.

Delhi court called the woman's testimony ""untrustworthy"" and full of contradictions.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has upheld the acquittal of a man by a trial court in a rape case, saying the woman's testimony was ""untrustworthy"", full on contradictions and she had called him 529 times between the date of alleged rape and the filing of the complaint.
A bench of Justices Manmohan and Sangita Dhingra Sehgal said it was in agreement with the trial court's view that the woman's testimony was ""highly unreliable"", ""untrustworthy"" and ""inspires no confidence"", while dismissing her appeal against the man's acquittal.
The trial court had acquitted the man on January 5.
The high court noted in its judgement that there were several contradictions in the woman's statement regarding how she met the man, how the alleged incident took place and why there was delay in reporting.
The woman had claimed before the trial court that she had met the man on LinkedIn, however, the same was not stated by her in the complaint to the police, the bench noted.
It added that the hotel where the alleged incident took place had 24 hour security despite which she did not raise alarm or ask them to call the police.
The other inconsistencies in her allegation the court noted were that even after getting her phone back from the man, who had allegedly taken it, she did not call the police for over 30 days and in-between called him 529 times.
The court noted that it was ""highly improbable"" that woman, being a daughter of a retired Commandant of CRPF and herself being a professor, could not make a call to the police or any other person after receiving her mobile phone.
""There is no evidence placed on record to suggest that the appellant- prosecutrix (woman) was administered intoxicating substance and its effect lasted for three days,"" the bench noted in the judgement and added that the factum of sexual intercourse was not proved.
It also noted that she had not handed over her mobile phone to the investigating officer (IO) and had deposed before the trial court that the police had not asked for it.
""However, the IO stated that she had asked the appellant-prosecutrix to hand over her mobile phone but she refused to do so,"" the court said, adding that ""appellant-prosecutrix had made 529 calls to accused-respondent 2 between December 16, 2016 (after the date of rape) to January 29, 2017 (before filing of the complaint). Her act of making so many repeated calls is not consistent with her allegations.""
The bench in conclusion said: ""Keeping in view the aforesaid cumulative findings, this court is of the view that the testimony of the appellant-prosecutrix is unreliable and inspires no confidence and there are compelling reasons for rejecting of her testimony.""
""There are also various lacunae in the case of the prosecution and the benefit of doubt will have to enure to the benefit of the accused-respondent 2. Consequently, the present appeal being bereft of merits, is dismissed.""

""It has been seven years but my daughter hasn't got justice,"" Nirbhaya's father said.
New Delhi:
""Films, shows banane se kya ho raha hai? Kitni films ban chuki hai Nirbhaya pe...7 saal ho gaye par abhi tak meri beti ko nyay tak nahi mila,"" the 58-year-old helpless Badrinath Singh said in a voice that indicated he had little hope of justice for his daughter even seven years after she was brutally killed.
He was referring to his daughter's case. Nothing happens when films and shows are made on my daughter's case. ""It has been seven years but my daughter hasn't got justice,"" he said.
On December 16, 2012, a 23-year-old paramedic student (named Nirbhaya by the media) was gang-raped and beaten up by six men in a moving bus in south Delhi. Her body was brutalised and thrown out of the bus, as was her male companion. After being treated in a Delhi hospital for 11 days, she was flown to Singapore for specialised treatment but died two days later on December 29, 2012.
The heinous incident, which shook the conscience of the entire nation and sent out waves of fear among the people, has now been brought alive on screen with the Netflix show ""Delhi Crime"".
It's a fictionalised series based on the case files of the Delhi Police who arrested the six perpetrators of the gang-rape within five days.
Richie Mehta's show is in the news since its release as it is making people revisit those horrific days.
IANS asked Nirbhaya's father, Badrinath Singh, for his views on the show.
""I haven't seen the show and do not even want to see it. It's hard to see all those things again.
""It's not that I am against this show. It should be real. I know it is a show and there will be fiction but I feel real people should be involved in the show. The names are changed in the show ...Real voices should be included. Neither am I supporting nor am I opposing the show.""
Badrinath also mentioned that he and his family were not a part of the show's making.
""The makers approached us many times. Even one month ago, they asked us to watch the show but we refused. We wanted real voices to be a part of the show ...So we didn't sign any deal or contract with them.""
The seven-episode series chornicles how DCP (South) Chhaya Sharma (played by actress Shefali Shah) and her team solved the case and managed to catch the culprits despite several hiccups.
Many have praised the show for portaying the sustained efforts of Delhi Police in cracking the case but there are others who have termed it ""skewed"" saying there were factual inaccuracies.
Neeraj Kumar, who Delhi's Police Commissioner at the time and who served as a consultant on ""Delhi Crime"", told IANS: ""The show depicts 60-65 per cent of the truth...the rest is fictionalised. The makers have used their creative liberty to dramatise the show. I won't say that whatever you will see in the show is 100 per cent true. But it's a good show as it depicts what the police had to go through through during the invesitagtion.""
There has also been criticism that the show tries to present Delhi Police in good light.
""The convicts were given death sentences...it all happened because of the solid work of the police force. Despite hurdles, we caught the accused, some of whom had escaped to other cities. So, saying the show whitewashes the image of the Delhi Police won't be fair.""
Mehta has previously explained why he directed the show in the manner he did.
""When I met them (police officers) and got to know them, all the way from deputy commissioners to sub-inspectors and constables, I realised that they had a perspective on this incident that we all desperately needed to hear and that this needed to be given a voice. So I proceeded on that belief.""
On his part, Badrinath hailed the Delhi Police. ""Police is the hero in my eyes.""
""The police helped us a lot. They made sure culprits got capital punishment. They were supporting us throughout the case.
""We still get police security...I am thankful to the entire Delhi Police team,"" he added.
""Delhi Crime"" ends with a group of policemen discussing over ice creams at India Gate the arrest of the six offenders, till they are informed that one of them had committed
suicide in jail. But for Badrinath, the agony will forever continue.
""Governments come and go...they are just interested in staying in power...They are not at all interested in doing something for our women. Sarkar badalti jaa rhi hai par cases wahi reh gaye hain...,"" -- governments change but the cases keep coming, Badrinath said.

Brajesh Thakur, alleged mastermind of Muzaffarpur shelter home case, was charged with serious offences
New Delhi:
A Delhi court Saturday framed various charges, including criminal conspiracy to commit rape and penetrative sexual assault, against all accused persons in the Muzaffarpur shelter home sexual assault case.
Additional Sessions Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha put 21 accused on trial, saying there was prima facie enough evidence against them.
Apart from rape and criminal conspiracy, the court also framed charges under different sections of the POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and other charges.
All the accused, who appeared before court, pleaded innocence and claimed trail.
Brajesh Thakur, alleged mastermind and strongman in the case, was charged with serious offences under the POCSO Act, including Section 6 (aggravated sexual assault).
The offence carries punishment of minimum 10 years and maximum of life imprisonment.
All 20 accused were charged with criminal conspiracy to commit rape and penetrative sexual assault against minors.
The court will hold trial for the offences of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, drugging of minors, criminal intimidation among other charges.
Key accused Thakur and employees of his shelter home, as well as Bihar department of social welfare officials were charged with criminal conspiracy, neglect of duty, failure to report assault on the girls.
The charges also included offence of cruelty to child under their authority, punishable under the Juvenile Justice Act.
On February 7, the Supreme Court ordered authorities to transfer the case from Bihar to a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court in Saket District Court complex in Delhi, which would conclude the trial within six months by holding preferably day-to-day hearing.
Several girls were allegedly raped and sexually abused at an NGO-run shelter home in Muzaffarpur, Bihar. The issue had come to light following a report by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS).

A fictionalised depiction, Netflix says it will “capture the complexities of the scrutiny, the emotional toll on the investigating team, and their determination to bring the perpetrators to justice in a fraught environment.” Starring the likes of Shefali Shah (Monsoon Wedding), Adil Hussain (Life of Pi, Hotel Salvation), Rasika Dugal (Mirzapur, Manto), and Rajesh Tailang (Siddharth, Selection Day), Delhi Crime has written and directed by award-winning Indo-Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta (Amal, Siddharth).
The first and only Delhi Crime trailer opens with a patrolling unit of the Delhi Police finding the victims on the side of a road, before we are introduced to our protagonist: DCP South Delhi, Varthika Chaturvedi (Shah). DCP stands for Deputy Commissioner of Police, which is the equivalent of the Superintendent of Police (SP) in the UK and across the Commonwealth. The trailer then lays out the basic facts of the case and what makes it unique, before Chaturvedi insists that they must catch the six suspects within the first 10 hours, otherwise all of them might disappear. It also touches upon the politicisation of the case, the public protests, and the anger and frustrations of the families involved.

 Delhi Crime has been produced by Mumbai-based, digital-focused Golden Karavan and Crazy Rich Asians' Ivanhoe Pictures. Golden Karavan's Aaron Kaplan, Jeff Sagansky, Florence Sloan, Apoorva Bakshi, Pooja Kohli, and Sanjay Bachani served as executive producers, alongside John Penotti, Kilian Kerwin, and Michael Hogan for Ivanhoe Pictures, with Robert Friedland, Sidney Kimmel, and Brian Kornreich as producers.

Swati Maliwal urged President Kovind to set a definite mechanism to give justice to victims of rape.
New Delhi:
Delhi Commission for Women chairperson Swati Maliwal requested President Ram Nath Kovind to streamline the judicial process to ensure hanging of the four convicts in the 2012 gang rape-and-murder case.
Three of the four convicts in the case, who were sentenced to death, are likely to file a curative petition challenging the death penalty soon.
A 23-year-old paramedic student, who later came to be known as Nirbhaya (fearless), was raped on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a running bus in South Delhi by six persons and severely assaulted before being thrown out on the road. She died on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.
One of the accused, Ram Singh, had hanged himself in the jail and another, a juvenile, was convicted of rape and murder and given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility.
In a letter addressed to President Kovind, Ms Maliwal said there should be a fixed timeline within which the entire judicial process needs to be completed to avoid such cases from dragging on.
""If deemed fit, your hon'ble self may kindly direct the Union Government to immediately introduce an ordinance in the country that ensures that in the cases of rape, the trial is completed within 3 months of the crime and further, all appeals, review petitions and curative petitions are disposed within the next three months. There should be guarantee of justice within 6 months,"" she said, in the letter to the president.
She urged President Kovind to set a definite mechanism to give justice to victims of rape.
""Further, I sincerely hope that your hon'ble self will issue strict directions to expedite the judicial process in the case of Nirbhaya and ensure that the convicts are hanged at the earliest,"" she said.

Many victims revealed that Brajesh Thakur used to bring people from outside for raping the girls.
New Delhi:
The CBI Saturday told a Delhi court that charges of rape, kidnapping and causing hurt were made out against Brajesh Thakur, the prime accused in the Muzaffarpur shelter sexual assault home case, and that several victims had given testimonies against him.
In initial arguments on framing of charges, the Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) for CBI told the court that statements of 33 victims have been recorded and most of them have testified against Thakur, besides revealing that he used to bring people from outside for raping the girls.
To this, Additional Sessions Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha said the charges cannot be clubbed together and directed the agency that for better understanding of the court, a table be made, listing out the date, place and details of the offence committed by every accused.
""If there are 33 victims, charges cannot be clubbed together. Date can be tentative. If he has committed rape with three different girls on the three different dates, then there will be three charges made out against him separately. These are separate offences and need to be charged separately. Make a table for every offence in which you can mention the date, place and crux of the matter,"" the court said.
The Supreme Court had on February 7 ordered that the shelter home sexual assault case be transferred from Bihar to a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court at Saket district court complex in New Delhi, which would conclude the trial within six months by holding preferably ""day-to-day"" trials.
Several girls were allegedly raped and sexually abused at an NGO-run shelter home in Muzaffarpur. The issue had come to light following a report by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS).
Arguments on the charges were addressed by counsels for accused Indu, Meena and Neha -- the caretakers of the victims who drugged the girls making them fall asleep, and two state social welfare department officials -- Ravi Raushan and Rosy Rani.
The agency submitted that Raushan and another accused Ramanuj Thakur alias Mamu, along with Brajesh Thakur, used to make these girls dance on vulgar songs in short dresses. It also said that two of the victims had testified that they were raped in a hotel outside the shelter home belonging to Thakur.
The agency levelled allegations against Rani that she was aware of the wrongdoing in the shelter home as the girls had complained to her but she turned a blind eye and there was a statement from a victim stating that Rani was also involved with the other accused in the exploitation of the girls.
To this, Rani's counsel said that she was not the perpetrator in any of the incidents nor was she physically present at the site. In fact, she was posted elsewhere months prior to the incidents.
The court fixed March 5 as the next date for advancing arguments.
Earlier the court had rapped the agency for the delay in notifying SPP in the case and warned it that any laxity to comply with the court's order will amount to contempt and action would be taken against the agency for it.
In the Muzaffarpur shelter home case, an FIR was lodged on May 31, 2018 against 11 people following the TISS report.
On the TISS report, the top court had said it raised grave concern about 17 shelter homes in Bihar and the CBI must look into all of them. Of these, the Muzaffarpur shelter home case was already being looked into by the CBI.
The probe was later taken over by the CBI and so far, 17 people have been arrested.
The amicus curiae had also told the court that there were 1,028 shelter homes across India where instances of sexual and physical abuse have been reported.

The top court had dismissed the pleas of Mukesh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma
New Delhi:
Three convicts in the 2012 gang rape and murder case might soon file a curative petition challenging the death penalty, a Delhi court was told today.
Additional Sessions Judge Anu Grover Baliga today heard a plea filed by the parents of Nirbhaya seeking death warrant of four convicts without any delay.
Advocate A P Singh, counsel for the convicts, told the court that they might soon file a curative petition challenging its 2018 order dismissing their pleas for a review of its 2017 verdict, which upheld the capital punishment awarded to them.
The 23-year-old paramedic student was raped on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, inside a running bus in South Delhi by six persons and severely assaulted before being thrown out on the road. She died on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.
The top court had in December last year dismissed a petition, seeking directions for the immediate execution of the four men convicted in the case.
The advocate told the court that the Tihar jail authorities have also stated the same in their reply to the plea.
The court also directed jail authorities to file a status report in the case by April 6 — the next date of hearing.
Seeking expeditious directions, the plea said that it is the need of the hour and law that the death sentence be executed as early as possible and not delayed any further.
""Not only the entire nation is awaiting the execution of the sentence awarded to the convicts, but the entire world is curiously looking at the Indian judicial system,"" the plea, filed through lawyer Jitendra Kumar Jha, read.
On July 9 last year, the top court had dismissed the pleas of three convicts — Mukesh (31), Pawan Gupta (24) and Vinay Sharma (25) — seeking review of its 2017 verdict upholding the capital punishment awarded to them by the Delhi High Court and the trial court in the case.
The fourth death row convict, Akshay Kumar Singh (33), has not filed a review plea in the top court.

New Delhi:
Five women were raped and eight were molested everyday on an average in the national capital last year, Delhi Police said on Wednesday.
According to Delhi Police data, 2,043 cases of rapes were registered last year as compared to 2,059 cases the year before that and 2,065 cases in 2016.
Last year, 3,175 cases of molestation were reported as compared to 3,275 cases the year before and 4,032 cases in 2016.
In most of the rape cases, the accused were known to the complainant, police said.
According to Delhi Police analysis, 43 per cent of the accused in rape cases were either friends or family friends, 16.25 per cent were neighbours, 12.04 per cent were relatives, 2.89 per cent were co-workers, 22.86 per cent were other known persons.
Just 2.5 per cent of the accused were not known to the victim, police said, adding that this was a decline from the previous years.
In 2017 and 2016, strangers comprised 3.36 and 3.57 per cent of those arrested for rape.
As many as 2,290 arrests were made in rape cases last year as compared to 2,275 in 2017 and 2,072 in 2018.
Police have requested the Delhi government for improving last mile connectivity and also requested the Social Welfare Department for initiating programmes for awareness and education in slums and places recording higher incidents of crime against women.
Delhi Police has also requested the city government for installation of lights on dark stretches, including self-defence as part of school curriculum.
As safety of women in the national capital continues to remain a cause of concern, police have laid emphasis on popularisation of 'Himmat Plus'', creating gender sensitisation and mindset reformation as a part of 'Sashakti''. Identification of dark stretches and sharing information with civic agencies is also on the fore.
Some of the sensational rape cases reported from the national capital included the rape of an employee of a multinational company by two of her colleagues in southwest Delhi's Vasant Kunj in October and the rape of a visually-impaired woman by her neighbour in central Delhi's Deshbandhu Gupta Road area in May last year.

Last year, 44,158 motor vehicle theft cases were reported as against 39,084 cases in 2017.
New Delhi:
Crimes in Delhi showed an upward trend last year, but statistics indicated that heinous incidents like rape and murder declined the year before, according to Delhi Police.
However, motor vehicle thefts continued to be the area of concern as there was a steep increase in the number of cases reported last year as compared to 2017.
Last year, 44,158 motor vehicle theft cases were reported as against 39,084 cases in 2017.
According to Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik, some of the important factors impacting crimes in Delhi are the high influx of migrant population, the pressures of leading a megacity life that leads to impulsive behaviour, disparities in income and proximity in location of colonies of the affluent and the under-privileged.
Police said 2,36,476 Indian Penal Code cases were registered last year as against 2,23,077 in 2017, showing an increase of 6.01 per cent.
Total IPC crime per lakh of population was 1,289 last year as compared to 1,244 crimes during the previous year.
Police said heinous crimes last year declined by 11.72 per cent, while major heads like dacoity, attempt to murder, robbery, rapes and riots saw a decline of 36.11, 16.26, 20.15, 0.78 and riot by 54 per cent respectively as compared to the previous year. Even the incidents of snatching and burglary have come down.
Owing to sustained efforts and professional investigation by districts and specialised units like the Crime Branch and the Special Cell, 91.16 per cent of heinous cases were worked out last year, as against 87 per cent the previous year. The detection in total IPC crimes also improved to 36.53 per cent from 34.6 per cent in 2017.
Last year, 477 cases of murder were registered as compared to 462 cases in 2017. Out of these, 86.16 per cent cases were solved. The incidents of murder per lakh of population have shown a significant decline during the last 14 years, coming down to 2.60 last year from 3.29 in 2004.
Last year, 2,307 cases of robbery were reported as compared to 2,889 cases in the corresponding period of last year.
In 2018, there has been reduction in cases pertaining to molestation of women by 3.05 per cent and insult to the modesty of women by 8.37 per cent.

10 Months After Death, Man Acquitted In 17-Year-Old Rape Case Of Daughter

The high court said that the prosecution and trial court picked out ""easy solutions"" (Representational)
New Delhi:
An erroneous approach of the trial court led to ""miscarriage of justice"" for a man convicted of allegedly raping his minor daughter 17 years ago, but justice was finally delivered to him when the Delhi High Court acquitted him on Wednesday - 10 months after he died while maintaining his innocence until the end
The high court noted that neither the probe nor the trial was fair in the case, lodged following a complaint by his daughter, which resulted in him being sentenced to 10 years in jail.
Justice R K Gauba said the accused ""had been crying foul from day one"" by claiming that some boy had kidnapped and seduced his daughter, who was found to be pregnant when the FIR of rape was lodged in January 1996, but the investigating agency and the trial court paid no heed to his contentions.
The father had asked for a DNA test of the foetus by taking samples from the boy in question as well, but the police did not listen and the trial court did not issue any directions for such an investigation, the high court noted.
""The investigation was clearly one-sided. At this distance in time, this court can only deplore the inaction on the part of all concerned. In the considered view of this court, there are many a fact and circumstance which have unfortunately been glossed over by the trial court but which render the account given by the prosecutrix to be wholly improbable and unreliable.
""Additionally, this court is of the view that neither the investigating agency nor the trial court were fair to the appellant at any stage of the process, this also vitiating the result of the probe and the trial,"" the high court said in its judgement acquitting the man, who died in February this year.
His wife had continued with the appeal.
The high court said that the prosecution and the trial court picked out ""easy solutions"" and the need for a deeper probe, as demanded by the man right from the start, was given a go-by.
""The defence evidence, particularly of the close members of the family was discarded. It is sad to note that the trial judge blindly accepted the prosecution story without going into the aspects which render it highly improbable, virtually impossible.
""The erroneous approach of the trial court has led to serious miscarriage of justice in the present case unreasonably holding the biological father of raping his own daughter in the teeth of loaded circumstances showing her to be of wayward ways and possibly in liaison with a male acquaintance,"" it said.
It also noted that the kidnapping FIR lodged by the father, after the then 16-year-old girl went missing, was closed without any probe after she lodged a complaint that he had been raping her since 1991.
Referring to the facts narrated by the girl before the trial court, the high court observed that ""there was no inhibition"" on the girl to report the matter and since according to her the rape began from 1991, nothing stopped her from communicating it to her mother, her siblings or other elders in the family.
""The delay is indeed inordinate and there are no justifiable reasons for failure to lodge protest.. The conduct is undoubtedly unnatural and highly improbable,"" the high court said adding that if he she had been raped in 1991 when she was just 12-years-old, then the consequent physical complications and pain would have been apparent, especially to the mother.
On the aspect of no DNA test being carried out by the police, the high court said ""the investigating agency and the prosecution appeared to have taken the stand that there was no need for it as from their perspective, it was an open and shut case, there being no reason why the daughter would accuse the father of such acts.
""This was neither a fair probe nor a fair trial. The boy was never brought in for DNA testing.""
According to the girl's complaint, her father, who was an electrician in the Military Engineer Services, had first raped her in 1991 when they were living in Udhampur in Jammu and Kashmir and her mother had gone to her brother-in-law's funeral.
Thereafter, whenever he found her alone he used to rape her and this continued after they came back to Delhi, she had alleged.
Her version was opposed by her father and mother as well as her elder brother and sister, who had claimed in the trial court that she was poor in studies, was of wayward nature, complaints were being received against her and therefore, her formal schooling was discontinued and she was sent for sewing classes run by an NGO, the high court noted.
It also observed that the father had also produced before the trial court his service records which indicated that in 1991 when his wife was away, he was posted in the field and did not get any leave. His family resided 40 km away.
The high court also noted that the police made no effort to ascertain whether the boy in question was involved in any manner, even though the mother had testified in the trial court that her daughter had claimed she was molested by him a few days before her disappearance.
The high court said that the possibility of physical intimacy between the boy and the girl ""required deeper probe. Unfortunately, there has been none"".
""On the foregoing facts, and in the circumstances, this court is not convinced by the conclusions reached by the trial court. The approach of the trial judge having been wholly misdirected and erroneous, the judgment of conviction cannot be allowed to stand,"" the high court said in its 22-page decision.

CBI Gets Nod To Proceed With Probe In Rape Case Against Daati Maharaj

The high court had earlier transferred the probe against Daati Maharaj from Delhi Police to the CBI
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Monday directed the CBI to proceed with its further investigation into the rape allegation against self-styled preacher Daati Maharaj and file its report before a trial court.
A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao, which had earlier asked the agency to submit the inquiry report to it, clarified that it should be filed before the magistrate who is dealing with the matter.
The court's clarification on filing of report came after the preacher's counsel submitted that as per the CrPC, the investigation/inquiry report has to be filed before the trial court and not the high court.
""We deem it appropriate to direct the CBI to proceed with the inquiry and file the report before the magistrate who shall proceed in accordance with the law,"" the bench said.
The high court disposed of the plea of the alleged victim, filed through advocate Pradeep Tiwari, seeking a CBI investigation into the matter and arrest of the accused. It also asked the parties and the CBI counsel to appear before the magistrate on November 26 for further directions.
The high court had earlier transferred the probe in the rape case against Daati Maharaj from Delhi Police to the CBI.
The preacher had filed a petition seeking review of the court's decision transferring the rape probe to the CBI. The court, however, had dismissed the plea on November 14.
The court had said the investigation was handed over to the CBI ""after going through the charge sheet in detail"" and after considering the plea moved by the ""victim herself"".
The preacher had contended that the CBI had started a fresh investigation in the case which was not permitted.
Dealing with the argument, the court had said it had directed only for further investigation by the CBI and not a de novo (fresh) probe.
On October 3, the high court had said the manner in which the probe was carried out by police ""casts a shadow on the investigation"" as it did not arrest the accused in the case even after recording the complainant's statement before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The preacher's plea against the October 3 order was initially filed in the Supreme Court which had asked him to approach the high court with his grievance.
The CBI had earlier submitted before the high court its status report on the probe in a sealed cover. The agency had registered a case of rape and unnatural sex against Daati Maharaj on October 26.
The complainant's plea was earlier being heard by a single judge bench of the high court, but was transferred to the division bench after a PIL on the issue was filed.
A complaint was filed against Daati Madan Lal alias Daati Maharaj on June 7 and an FIR was registered on June 11. On June 22, police questioned the accused, who has been charged with rape of a disciple at his ashrams in Delhi and Rajasthan.
The accused has claimed that he was being framed.
The complainant has filed the case against the preacher, his three brothers and a woman at Fatehpur Beri police station in South Delhi. The case was later transferred to the crime branch.

Daati Maharaj on November 2 had told the high court that the CBI has lodged a fresh FIR in the matter against followed norms.
The Delhi Police, represented by additional standing counsel Sanjoy Ghose, had told the bench that its probe into the case was not partisan as alleged by the victim and added that the preacher was interrogated eight times during the investigation.
Police, however, had said that it was not challenging the transfer of probe to the CBI.
After hearing all the sides, the bench had reserved its order on Daati Maharaj's plea for review of the court's October 3 decision.
The plea against the October 3 order was initially filed in the Supreme Court which had asked the self-styled preacher to approach the high court with his grievance.

Daati Maharaj had claimed he was being framed in the case (File)
New Delhi:
The CBI has registered a case against self-styled preacher Daati Maharaj, who runs a temple in south Delhi, for allegedly raping and having unnatural sex with an inmate of his ashram, officials said Friday.
The agency had taken over investigation in the case on the instructions of the Delhi High Court, they said.
On a complaint by a woman disciple, a case of rape and unnatural sex was filed against Daati Maharaj, his three brothers and a woman at Fatehpur Beri Police Station in south Delhi.
On June 22, the police had questioned Daati Maharaj also known as Daati Madanlal, who was charged with rape of a disciple at his ashrams in Delhi and Rajasthan.
The accused had claimed he was being framed in the case.
A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao had allowed the complainant woman's plea to transfer the matter to the CBI, saying the manner in which the Delhi Police carried out the probe ""casts a shadow on the investigation"".
It is possibly the first case registered by the agency after a midnight drama in which its Director Alok Verma and Special Director Rakesh Asthana were divested of all powers by the government on the recommendation of Central Vigilance Commission.

The country recently saw a series of protests over rising crimes against women.
Jalpaiguri (West Bengal):
A woman was allegedly raped and brutalised with an iron rod in West Bengal's Jalpaiguri district on Saturday night, bringing back memories of the horrific 2012 Delhi gang-rape. The woman has been admitted to the Jalpaiguri Sadar Hospital in a critical state. The police have detained the accused, a relative, and a companion for questioning.
According to the police, the accused called the woman to a pond near their home in Niranjan Pat area on the pretext of discussing a land dispute. He then allegedly raped her and attacked her with a rod. Although the accused was accompanied by another person, he did not participate in the assault.
A rickshaw-puller later came upon the woman and took her home. The rape survivor's husband was not around at the time.
The beastly attack drew comparisons to the 2012 Delhi gang-rape when a 23-year-old medical student was raped on a moving bus in the national capital on the night of December 16, 2012. She died in a Singapore hospital 13 days after the incident from her injuries.
While the Supreme Court sentenced five of the rapists to death on May 5, 2017, a juvenile convict involved in the attack was freed after serving the maximum jail sentence of three years.
In recent months, the country has seen protests over the increasing number of crimes against women. The rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl near Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir in January this year and the alleged sexual assault of a 7-year-old girl by a legislator at Unnao in Uttar Pradesh on June 4, 2017 had a triggered nationwide uproar.

Self-styled godman Daati Maharaj, accused of raping a disciple has moved the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court's order transferring the case to the CBI. The high court had on October 3 pulled up the Delhi Police for not arresting Daati Maharaj in the case and had transferred the matter to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
His plea is scheduled to come up for hearing in the top court on October 22 before a bench of justices NV Ramana and MM Shantanagoudar.
A complaint was filed against Daati Madan Lal alias Daati Maharaj on June 7 and an FIR was registered on June 11.
The high court, while transferring the case to the CBI, had said the manner in which police had carried out the probe ""casts a shadow on the investigation"".
The high court had said police did not arrest the accused in the case even after recording of the complainant's statement before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The police had claimed before the high court that arrests were not made in the case as there were discrepancies and contradictions in the woman's statement.
It had also alleged that other women, who according to the complainant were also assaulted by the accused, have denied such allegations when they were questioned.
A trial court had earlier taken strong exception to the manner in which probe was being conducted in the case, saying the investigating officer had not been able to explain the efforts made to ensure that the accused does not flee during the investigation.
It had directed the deputy commissioner of police (Crime Branch) to monitor the probe and ensure a status report is filed before the court every week.

Delhi High Court Acquits Man In Rape-Murder Case Of 81-Year-Old Woman

The High Court order to set aside a trial court's conviction order came on man's appeal.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court on Thursday acquitted a man of the charges of raping and murdering an 81-year-old widow at her south Delhi residence over four years ago.
The High Court, however, dubbed the crime as ""horrific"" and said that an elderly woman had been done to death in the most inhuman manner.
A bench of Justices S. Muralidhar and Vinod Goel acquitted domestic help Neeraj Safi of the charges pressed under Sections 302 (murder), 375 (rape) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code.
The High Court order to set aside a trial court's conviction order came on Safi's appeal.
""Howsoever strong a suspicion might be, it cannot constitute proof and is insufficient to return a finding of guilt. The case against the appellant had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution has failed to do that in the present case,"" the bench said.
Safi, a resident of Madhubani in Bihar, was accused of the crime at his employer's Greater Kailash-II house on July 7, 2014. On January 31 2017, the trial court convicted Safi of rape, murder and destruction of evidence.
The High Court also said that the prosecution has failed to prove the motive of the crime as nothing belonging to the deceased was in fact stolen and other household items remained untouched.
""The trial court overlooked the above legal position and erred in holding that not proving the motive was not fatal to the case of the prosecution,"" the court said.
The High Court also found that there are too many gaps in the chain of circumstances leading to the crime.
""Neither the forensics report nor the post-mortem conclusively establishes that it was the appellant who had any sexual contact with the deceased,"" the court said.
""With medical and forensic evidence ruling out the possibility of the appellant having committed the sexual assault on the deceased, the prosecution has failed to prove the motive for the crime.""
Police had said that the woman's post-mortem revealed that she was beaten up, strangled with a dupatta and set on fire.

Jessica Lal killer Manu Sharma's request for early release has been rejected
There will be no early release for the killers convicted in the Naina Sahni, Jessica Lal and Priyadarshini Mattoo murder cases. Delhi government's Sentence Review Board (SRB) on Thursday rejected the request for early release of over a hundred prisoners. This included Sushil Sharma, who was convicted of murdering Naina Sahni, Santosh Singh who was convicted of raping and murdering Priyadarshini Mattoo and Jessica Lal's killer Manu Sharma. All three convicts are serving a life imprisonment sentence and are presently lodged in Tihar Jail.
Here's a brief history of the three cases.
Naina Sahni case
One of the most brutal murders Delhi has seen, Naina Sahni was shot dead by her husband Sushil Sharma on the night of July 2, 1995. Sharma tried to dispose the body by taking it to a restaurant where he was helped by the manager Keshav Kumar.
The body was chopped to pieces and put into a tandoor (clay oven) to burn. Both Sushil Sharma and Naina Sahni were part of the Youth Congress. Sushil Sharma is said to have killed Sahni in a fit of rage due to her friendship Matloob Karim, also a Youth Congress member.
Naina Sahni's body was chopped into pieces and stuffed into a tandoor
The first post-mortem report conducted at Lady Hardinge Medical College was misleading as it said that the death was caused by burn injuries. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi ordered a second post-mortem, which was conducted by doctors from three different hospitals. It detected two bullets in the head and neck region, which changed the entire direction of the case.
Delhi Police filed a chargesheet against Sharma on July 27, 1995. On November 7, 2003, a lower court sentenced Sushil Sharma to death and the restaurant manager Keshav Kumar was sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment. Sharma appealed against the verdict in the Delhi High Court. But on February 19, 2007, the High Court upheld the lower court's decision. Sushil Sharma appealed to the Supreme Court.
On October 8, 2013, the Supreme Court upheld Sushil Sharma's conviction but commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. The justification given by the Supreme Court was that the crime was committed because of the accused's strained relationship with his wife and not a crime against society. Therefore it wasn't held to be in the ""rarest of rare"" category.
Priyadarshini Mattoo case
On January 23, 1996, 23-year-old law student Priyadarshini Mattoo was raped and killed by Santosh Singh. Singh, son of IPS officer JP Singh, was also a law student along with Mattoo.
The Delhi police filed the FIR but the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation two days after the murder. On April 11, 1996, the CBI filed a chargesheet against Santosh Singh and the trial began over a year later. The court acquitted Santosh Singh on December 3, 1999 amidst widespread outrage and allegations that money had changed hands in the case. Reacting to Singh's acquittal, the then President of India KR Narayanan had remarked, ""The cathedrals of justice have become like casinos"".
Priyadarshini Mattoo was raped and killed by Santosh Singh on January 23, 1996
Under fire for its alleged lapses in the probe, the CBI filed an appeal in the Delhi High Court in February 2000. The High Court delivered its judgement on October 17, 2006, convicting Santosh Singh for raping and killing Priyadarshini Mattoo, The court accepted evidence against Singh that he was stalking the victim. He was seen outside her house on the day of murder. On October 30, 2006, the Delhi High Court sentenced Santosh Singh to death. He challenged the sentence at the Supreme Court, which commuted it to life imprisonment four years later.
Jessica Lal case
On April 29, 1999, model and celebrity bartender at Tamarind Court restaurant, Jessica Lal, shot was dead by Siddharth Vashishta alias Manu Sharma. Many Sharma is the son of prominent Haryana politician Vinod Sharma.
Manu Sharma, accompanied by his friends Tony, Alok Khanna and Vikas Yadav, visited the Tamarind Court on the day of the murder. He was already drunk but asked for more liquor from the celebrity barmaid Jessica Lal, which she refused. An enraged Manu then shot at Jessica Lal twice at point blank range, killing her. After absconding for five days, Manu Sharma surrendered on May 6, 1999.
Delhi Police filed a chargesheet in the court of Metropolitan Magistrate on August 3, 1999, naming Manu Sharma as the main accused in the murder.
In April this year, Manu Sharma was transferred to a so-called ""open cell""
The trial witnessed a major twist after eyewitness Shayan Munshi, also a model and a friend of Jessica Lal, turned hostile on May 3, 2001. However, Bina Ramani, the owner of Tamarind Court, stood firm to her testimony and identified Manu Sharma as the person whom she had tried to stop from fleeing the crime scene.
On February 21, 2006, Manu Sharma and eight others were acquitted the lower court. This led to a huge public outcry. The Delhi High Court took suo moto notice of the acquittal and reopened the case after an appeal by the Delhi Police.
The Delhi High court conducted regular hearings and on December 18, 2006, it charged Manu Sharma with murder, destroying evidence and under the Arms Act. It sentenced him to life imprisonment.
Manu Sharma appealed to the Supreme Court which upheld the life sentence on April 19, 2010.
In November 2009, the then chief minister of Delhi Sheila Dikshit approved a two month parole for Manu Sharma, a decision for which she had face a great deal of criticism.
In April this year, Manu was transferred to a so-called ""open jail"" because of ""good conduct"". He is allowed to go out of jail from 8 am to 6 pm to volunteer with a Non-Government Organisation run by himself.

Following a huge outcry, the Nitish Kumar government handed over the probe to the CBI.

The brutal gang rape and murder had evoked massive protests across the country.
New Delhi:
The Delhi Commission for Women issued a notice on Monday to Tihar Jail authorities over ""delay"" in execution of convicts in the December 15, 2012 Nirbhaya rape and murder case.
In May last year, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence to four men convicted of the savage rape and murder of the 23-year-old paramedic student, terming it as an attack ""most brutal, barbaric and diabolical"".
In July this year, the top court dismissed review pleas filed by three of the convicts while the fourth convict did not seek a review.
Issuing the notice to Tihar Jail authorities, DCW Chairperson Swati Maliwal demanded an explanation over the ""delay"" in execution of these convicts. She said that they ""should be executed at the earliest in order to create a strong deterrence in the society"".
Ms Maliwal said the authorities have been asked to inform whether an order authorizing the execution of the sentence of the death has been issued or not. ""Further, submit reasons, in case execution orders have not been issued. The authorities have been asked to submit reply by 15.09.2018,"" it said.
 Six men had brutally gang raped the woman, who later known came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"".
She was thrown out of the bus -so grievously injured that her insides were spilling out - along with her male friend near the airport. A fortnight later, on December 29, 2012, she succumbed in a Singapore hospital.
""Our country's capital, Delhi, is today disgraced with having received the tag of 'Rape Capital' of the world. A major reason for such crimes to continue unabated is the lack of deterrence created by the system,"" Maliwal said. 
""There appears to be hardly any fear of law in the minds of the perpetrators. Therefore, it is extremely crucial that the death sentence awarded to the rapists of Nirbhaya is executed at the earliest in order to create a strong deterrence in the society. Nirbhaya and her parents deserve justice,"" she was quoted as saying in a statement by the DCW.

The woman filed a case, alleging rape and unnatural sex, against Daati Maharaj (File)
New Delhi:
A woman who filed a sexual assault case against self-styled godman Daati Maharaj on Tuesday approached the Delhi High Court and sought a CBI probe.
The woman has demanded seizure of the ashrams of the self-styled godman and immediate arrest of the accused in the case.
The Delhi High Court last week suggested to an NGO seeking a CBI probe into the case to file a fresh plea along with the woman's affidavit.
The bench observed that since the NGO, which filed the plea, was not the victim, it had no locus standi in the matter. The NGO then withdrew the plea.
The incident came to light after the woman filed a case at Fatehpur Beri police station alleging rape and unnatural sex against the self-style godman, the founder of the Delhi-based Shree Shanidham Trust.

Nirbhaya Rape case: The 2012 incident sparked a new debate about women's safety in the country
India's Supreme Court on Monday rejected the pleas to review the capital sentences of three assailants in a notorious gang rape and murder of a young college student that shook India in 2012, bringing them one step closer to eventual execution.
In May last year, India's highest court upheld the 2013 death penalty verdicts for four of the six assailants who gang-raped and tortured a 23-year-old college student in New Delhi in December 2012, saying they did not deserve leniency due to ""brutal, barbaric and diabolical"" conduct.
The brutal attack prompted widespread protests throughout the country, sparked a new debate about women's safety in India and resulted in strict changes to the country's rape laws which now allows for the death penalty in some rape cases.
On Monday, the court rejected the review petition of three of the six assailants - Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma, all in their 20s - who had asked the court to consider commuting their death sentence to life imprisonment.
The convicted assailants have not yet exhausted all legal options - they can still seek a curative petition from the court for example - so the process may drag out for years. The fourth assailant has not yet filed a review plea.
A lawyer for the men, A.P. Singh, told reporters at the courthouse after the verdict that ""injustice"" had been done to the convicted murderers - using the Hindi word for ""boys"" to describe them - and the court had caved to public and political pressure to uphold the death penalty.
India has long exercised the death penalty as punishment for serious crimes; its last execution was in 2015 of Yakub Memon for his role in the 1993 terrorist bombings in Mumbai.
The young woman's parents, Asha Devi and Badrinath Singh, applauded the court's decision but said that they have been waiting too long for a resolution.
""I want that as soon as possible they are hanged to death,"" Devi said in an interview with The Post. ""There's no word to describe what I'm going through. It is very difficult. First lose your child and then go through all this. Even after today, they can still appeal further, so we don't know how long we will have to fight.""
Their daughter - a physical therapy student who became known as ""Nirbhaya"" which means ""fearless"" - had gone to see the ""Life of Pi"" with a male friend at a popular New Delhi mall cineplex on the night of Dec. 16, 2012 when they boarded a private bus to make their way home to a neighborhood on the outskirts of India's capital city.
The men - who court documents said were drunk, cruising and looking for sex - attacked the couple, raping and tortured the young woman with an iron rod before tossing the pair from the bus. The young man survived but the woman died later at a hospital in Singapore. Of six assailants eventually arrested, the fifth man died in prison in 2013 and the sixth was a juvenile who served his three-year sentence in a youth offender facility.
In the years since, women's advocates say that the Nirbhaya case raised awareness, prompting more women to come forward if they're abused or assaulted, with authorities responding to the concerns with more closed-circuit security cameras and fast track courts for crimes against women. A review of these courts by The Washington Post in 2016 found that they varied in effectiveness, however.
But the number of reported rapes continue to rise - from about 25,000 in 2012 to 38,000 in 2016, according to government crime data.
Earlier this year, the issue of women's safety erupted again after an 8-year-old Muslim girl was gang-raped and killed in the northern state of Jammu & Kashmir and a lawmaker from the governing Bharatiya Janata Party was arrested and charged with raping a teenager. India's cabinet subsequently approved an emergency ordinance allowing the death penalty for the gang rape of children under the age of 12.

Nirbhaya became a symbol for widespread campaigns in India on women's rights and safety (File)
New Delhi:
Supreme Court on Monday upheld death sentences for three men over the infamous gang-rape and murder of a woman in New Delhi in 2012 that sparked national protests and led to tough new penalties for sexual violence.
The horrific violence meted out to 23-year-old on a bus in the national capital sparked angry protests and shone unprecedented attention on the scourge of sexual crimes against women in the country.
The case spurred a major overhaul of laws governing such crimes, faster prosecutions in courts and harsher punishments for perpetrators.
Here are five questions and answers about the watershed case.
Who was the victim?
Nirbhaya's father moved the family from their small farming village in rural Uttar Pradesh to the bustling capital in search of work.
It was hoped Nirbhaya would become the first professional in the family, and all energies were channelled into her studies at a private physiotherapy college.
Her father earned just $200 per month as an airport baggage handler but sold ancestral land to help pay for his daughter's tuition.
To supplement her family's meagre income, Nirbhaya worked nights at an outsourcing firm and gave private lessons to school children.
What happened on December 16, 2012?  
Nirbhaya was returning from the cinema after watching 'Life of Pi' with a friend when they were offered a ride in a private bus.
Six men, including a juvenile, beat Nirbhaya's friend unconscious before raping and torturing her with an iron bar as the bus drove loops through the city.
She was dumped on the streets 45 minutes later with horrific internal injuries, and died 13 days later in a Singapore hospital.
Why is this case extraordinary?
The savagery of the attack proved a tipping point in a city where an average of six women is raped every day.
Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Delhi demanding swifter justice for victims and tougher laws to punish perpetrators.
It also led to much soul-searching about the treatment of women in India, which suffers from extremely high levels of sexual assault and where discrimination against women and girls is rife.
As Nirbhaya struggled to survive long enough to help police identify her attackers, she became a symbol of India's long-overdue campaign to end sexual violence against women.
What happened to the attackers?
The accused were low-paid migrants to New Delhi, among them a bus cleaner, a gym assistant, a fruit seller and a school dropout.
Four were convicted in September 2013 for murder, gang-rape, theft, conspiracy and ""unnatural acts"" after a seven-month trial in a fast-track court.
A fifth man, the suspected ringleader, was found dead in jail in a suspected suicide, while the 17-year-old was sentenced to three years in a detention centre and has since been released.
Sentencing the four in 2013, Judge Yogesh Khanna said the case fell into the ""rarest of rare category"" which justifies capital punishment.
Just three were involved in the appeal rejected on Monday.
What changes came of it?
In the aftermath of the crime, a panel headed by a former chief justice was tasked with reviewing laws on sexual violence.
The panel recommended a minimum sentence of 20 years for gang-rape, with the possibility of life imprisonment.
It also called for tougher punishments for a range of sexual crimes common across India, including voyeurism, stalking and acid attacks.
The government responded by introducing tougher punishments for rapists, including the death penalty for repeat offenders.

The Nirbhaya gang-rape led to big changes to laws on sexual crimes against women.
New Delhi:
The men convicted of raping and torturing a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012 will hang, the Supreme Court ruled today, confirming its earlier decision and rejecting the request of three of four convicts for their sentence to be reduced to a life term. The top court was asked to reconsider its own ruling in a review plea; the convicts are left with one more legal option of challenging their sentence before they appeal to the President for mercy.
Here are the top 10 points in this big story:
""There is no new material to review our order,"" said three judges led by Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, on the review petition of Mukesh, 29, Pawan Gupta, 22 and Vinay Sharma, 23.
The fourth death row convict, Akshay Kumar Singh, 31, has not filed a review petition against the Supreme Court's judgement in May last year.
""People of our country have got justice. We hope the process is completed soon and the rapists get death, and society is safer for women,"" said the woman's mother, Asha Devi, on the court ruling that brings the convicts one step closer to execution.
A lawyer for the convicts, AP Singh, told reporters that ""injustice"" had been done to the convicted murderers - using the Hindi word for ""boys"" to describe them - and the court had caved to public and political pressure.
The Supreme Court had last year upheld the decisions of the Delhi High Court and the trial court sentencing the four men to death for raping the young woman, who died 16 days after the savage assault.
In its judgement, the Supreme Court had said that the ""brutal, barbaric and diabolic nature"" of the crime could create a ""tsunami of shock"" to destroy a civilised society.
The convicts appealed to the court to review their sentence, saying it was ""cold-blooded killing in the name of Justice"". The court agreed to hear their request in November last year.
The gang-rape of the 23-year-old student, who was returning home with a friend after watching ""The Life of Pi"" on December 16, 2012, provoked rage and shock across India and led to big changes to laws on sexual crimes against women.
Of the six accused, bus driver Ram Singh killed himself in his prison cell. The youngest accused, just days short of 18 when he committed the crime, was sent to a juvenile home, from where he was released after a three-year term.
The woman came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" or fearless. Her parents have said that all the rapists should be hanged at the earliest, including the youngest.

The para-medic student was gang-raped and assaulted in a moving bus by six men.
New Delhi:
Hours before the judgment on the review petitions filed by the accused in the 2012 Delhi gang rape, women activists on Monday hoped justice would be served to the victim and her family.
Speaking to ANI, women activist Annie Raja said that a message needs to be sent across the society through this judgment.
""The family of Nirbhaya, who have been waiting for justice since years, should find peace. Through this verdict, a message needs to be spread in the society that if you commit such a heinous crime, you will have to face the consequences,"" Ms Raja said.
Ms Raja also said justice should be delivered to the victims of such crimes in a time-bound manner.
""None of the rape cases should be used for a political purpose,"" she added.
Echoing similar views, another women activist, Sandhya Rani, said that quick reaction and response on rape cases is essential.
""Nirbhaya case is a landmark case (a court case that is studied because it has historical and legal significance). I wish justice will be given to Nirbhaya and her family,"" she added.
The Supreme Court will pronounce judgment on the review petitions filed by the three convicts in the brutal December 2012 Delhi gang-rape case at 2 pm today.
The apex court had on May 4 reserved its order on the review petitions filed by the convicts-- Pawan Gupta(31), Vinay Sharma (25), and Mukesh (31).
A three-judge bench of the top court, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Dipak Misra and also comprising Justice Ashok Bhushan and R Bhanumathi, will pronounce the verdict in the case.
The fourth convict, Akshay Thakur (33) has not filed a review petition yet. The apex court had however in the last hearing, granted three weeks' time to Akshay to file his review petition in the case.
According to the prosecution, the 23-year-old para-medical student was assaulted and raped by six persons in a moving bus in South Delhi and thrown out with her male friend on the night of December 16, 2012. She subsequently died during the treatment at a Singapore hospital on December 29 the same year.
Of  the six convicts, prime accused Ram Singh had allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail in 2013 during the trial of the case. Another accused was found out by the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) as a minor and sentenced to three years term at a probation home.
Saket's Fast-track Court on September 13, 2013, pronounced death sentence to all the four convicts. The trial court then referred the case to the Delhi High Court for confirmation of their death sentence.
The Delhi High Court had on January 2017, reserved its verdict on confirming the death sentence and appeals of the four convicts.
The Supreme Court had on May 5, last year, upheld the Delhi High Court order of death penalty to the four convicts, following which three convicts of them appealed before the Supreme Court for review its order of sentencing them to the gallows.

2012 Delhi Gang Rape Case: Supreme Court will decide today if the four men deserve any mercy
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court will today decide whether the four men sentenced to death for raping and torturing a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012, triggering nationwide protests, deserve mercy. The top court will announce its verdict on a review plea filed by three of the four convicts seeking reduction of their death sentence to a life term.
Here is the 10-point cheatsheet:

Mahaakshay Chakraborty's scheduled marriage today was also cancelled
New Delhi:
A Delhi court today granted anticipatory bail to veteran actor Mithun Chakraborty's wife Yogita Bali and son Mahaakshay Chakraborty in a complaint of alleged rape and cheating filed by a woman.
Special Judge Ashutosh Kumar granted the relief to Yogita Bali and Mahaakshay saying they have deep roots in society and are not likely to abscond.
""Accordingly, it is ordered that in the event of arrest, both the applicants shall be released on a personal bond of Rs one lakh with two sureties each of the like amount,"" the judge said.
Meanwhile, the scheduled marriage of Mahaakshay in Udhagamandalam (Ooty) in Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu was today cancelled following arrival of a police team to investigate the case, police sources said.
An FIR was lodged pursuant to court's order on the complainant of a woman who alleged that Mahaakshay had cheated and raped her. She alleged he had physical relations with her for around four years after promising her marriage.
The court had said that prima facie there are sufficient grounds for registration of an FIR against Ms Bali and Mahaakshay Chakraborty and to proceed further in accordance with the law.
The woman alleged in her complaint that when she became pregnant, Mahaakshay had given her some medicine which led to an abortion.
In her complaint, she claimed that Yogita Bali had threatened her of dire consequences if she continues the relationship. The complainant also said in court that she moved to Delhi from Mumbai as she feared for her life in view of threats made by Bali and her son.
After the arrival of the investigating team, the marriage was cancelled and the bride's family left the place, police said.

Daati Maharaj was questioned for nearly seven hours by the Crime Branch
New Delhi:
A Delhi Court on Monday questioned the Delhi Police as to why self-styled godman Daati Maharaj has not been arrested yet despite search warrants being issued in the rape case.
The court also directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Crime branch, to monitor the investigation and file a status or progress report before the Court every week.
Daati Maharaj, accused of raping a disciple inside Shani Dham two years ago, has been booked under Sections 376, 377, 354 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
On June 21, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), in a letter to the Delhi Police, had also raised questions regarding the delay in the arrest of Daati Maharaj.
They also enquired about the failure to send a report of the action taken in the matter within the stipulated time frame.
The victim had stated that she was also raped at Gurukul Ashwasan in Rajasthan's Bal Gram, adding that she did not file a complaint earlier as she felt intimidated by the self-styled godman.
On June 19, Daati Maharaj had arrived at the premises of the Delhi Police Crime Branch as part of the investigation into the rape case.
On Tuesday, Daati Maharaj and three others were questioned for close to seven hours at the Crime Branch office at Chanakyapuri.

The police are mulling getting a potency test conducted on Daati Maharaj.
New Delhi:
Three men, accused by self-styled godman Daati Maharaj of framing him in a rape case, were questioned by the police.

They were questioned for over six hours at the Crime Branch office at Chanakyapuri. The godman has been called for questioning today.

Last week, the godman was questioned for over eight hours in connection with the case and he had claimed that the three men, who were earlier associated with one of his ashrams, had ""framed him"" in the case.

The police are mulling getting a potency test conducted on Daati Maharaj.

The godman's brother, a co-accused in the case, was also questioned by the police last week.

The woman had filed the complaint against Daati Maharaj, his three brothers and a woman at the Fatehpur Beri police station in south Delhi earlier this month. The case was later transferred to the Crime Branch.

The victim has alleged that she was sexually abused at Daati Maharaj's ashrams in Delhi and Rajasthan.

The woman has told the police that she was a disciple of Daati Maharaj for a decade, but after she was raped by him, she had returned to her home in Rajasthan.

Daati Maharaj was questioned on Friday by the police for over seven hours (File Photo)
New Delhi:
Self-styled godman Daati Maharaj, accused of raping a disciple in his ashrams in New Delhi and Rajasthan, has accused three persons of conspiring against him, following which the trio have been summoned by police, an official said.

Daati Maharaj was questioned on Friday by the police for over seven hours in connection with the case.

The godman claimed that three persons, who were earlier associated with the ashram, had ""framed him"" in the case.

The three persons have been called for questioning on Monday by the Crime Branch while the godman has been again called for questioning on Tuesday, the official said, adding that police might get a potency test conducted on the godman.

Earlier this week, Daati Maharaj's brother, a co-accused in the case, was also questioned.

The self-styled godman was questioned by the police for over seven hours on Tuesday. His younger brother was also named by the survivor in her complaint to the police.

Last Saturday, a Delhi Police team, accompanied by the rape survivor, had visited the self-godman's ashram in Pali, Rajasthan, to gather evidence, but they failed to find him at the ashram.

The woman had filed the complaint against Daati Maharaj, his three brothers and a woman at the Fatehpur Beri police station in south Delhi earlier this month. The case was later transferred to the Crime Branch.

The survivor alleged that she was sexually abused at Daati Maharaj's ashrams in Delhi and Rajasthan.

The woman told the police that she had been a disciple of Daati Maharaj for a decade but after she was raped by him, she returned to her home in Rajasthan.

The Delhi Police had earlier issued a lookout notice against him to ensure that he does not leave the country.

Self-styled godman Daati Maharaj is accused of raping a woman disciple.
New Delhi:
Self-styled godman Daati Maharaj, accused of raping a disciple in his ashrams, was questioned by Delhi Police for over seven hours last evening. A woman, in her complaint filed last Sunday in south Delhi, alleges that Daati Maharaj repeatedly raped her at his ashrams in Delhi and Rajasthan two years ago.

Police said, during the questioning that began at around 2:30 pm yesterday, he was grilled on the allegations levelled against him by the woman and whether he knew her. The woman has also named two male disciples of the saffron-clad man in her complaint. She said that she was raped at Gurukul Ashwasan in Rajasthan's Bal Gram, adding that she did not file a complaint earlier as she felt intimidated by the self-styled godman.

Daati Maharaj denied these allegations, police said. A senior police officer said that he has been asked to appear again for questioning on Friday.

Last Saturday, a Delhi Police team had visited his ashram in Rajasthan's Pali to gather evidence. The team, which failed to find him at the ashram, was accompanied by the woman. ""I had already mentioned to all of you that I am a worker of this nation. I am not an absconder. Whenever they will call me I will always come and cooperate with them,"" he told reporters yesterday.

The Swati Maliwal-led Delhi Commission for Women had recently sough reasons for the delay in arresting the self-declared godman.

Police had earlier issued a lookout circular against Daati Maharaj to ensure that he does not leave the country.

The woman has told the police that she had been a disciple of Daati Maharaj for a decade but after she was raped by him, she returned to her home in Rajasthan.

Yesterday, Yoga guru Ramdev said that self-styled godmen involved in illegal activities should be hanged to death for violating the limits of their work. ""Whoever violates those limits should not only be sent to jail, but should be hanged till death. There should not be any compromise on this,"" Ramdev said.

Daati Maharaj has been asked to come in for questioning on Wednesday, police said
New Delhi:
Self-styled godman Daati Maharaj has been given a notice by the Delhi Police asking him to join a probe in the rape case registered against him by a former disciple, police said on Monday. The notice asks him to come for questioning on Wednesday, police said.

Daati Maharaj, who is the founder of the Delhi based Shree Shanidham Trust, has been accused of allegedly raping one of his disciples in his ashrams in Rajasthan and South Delhi's Mehrauli two years ago. Two of his male disciples have also been named in the woman's complaint.

On Saturday, a Delhi Police team visited the self-styled godman's ashram in Pali, Rajasthan to gather evidence. But the team, accompanied by the 25-year-old woman who filed the complaint, could not find Daati Maharaj at the ashram. The police also visited his ashram in Delhi's Chhatarpur on Friday.

The woman had filed the complaint against Daati Maharaj last Sunday at the Fatehpur Beri police station in south Delhi. The case was transferred to the Crime Branch. The woman has told the police that she had been a disciple of Daati Maharaj for a decade but after she was raped by him, she returned to her home in Rajasthan.

A lookout notice was issued against the self-styled godman on Thursday to ensure he doesn't leave the country. 

Daati Maharaj had told reporters on Thursday that the woman was ""like my daughter"" and claimed that he would cooperate in the investigation. ""I won't blame that girl because she was my daughter and will continue to be that. Even if I am hanged, I won't accuse her. If I have done anything wrong, then the legal authorities will look into that,"" he had said.

The Delhi Commission for Women wrote to the Deputy Commissioner of Police asking why there was a delay in arresting Daati Maharaj. ""It has come to the knowledge of the Commission through media reports that the accused Daati Maharaj has not been arrested till now and he is giving interviews to the media from his ashram. This is a very serious matter,"" the letter stated.

Mohit Goel (right) made headlines by offering world's cheapest smartphone (File)
New Delhi:
Mohit Goel, who once made international headlines by offering the world's cheapest smartphone, was arrested by the police on Sunday in an extortion case along with two others. News agency ANI reported that those arrested were allegedly trying to extort money for settling a rape case in Delhi.

Mr Goel was the founder of a company called Ringing Bells. In 2016, the company made waves by offering Freedom 251 smartphones for an unbelievable price of Rs 251. 

The world's cheapest phone made a splash across the globe with almost every big media house writing about the gadget.

Around 30,000 customers paid for it and pre-ordered the phone online and about seven crore people registered to buy it when it went on sale. The sale however was plagued by several technical problems.

Ringing Bells later began selling the phone along with several other models and accessories through Amazon India.

Since then, the company faced inquiries by police and tax officials. Eventually it had to shut shop.

Last December, Mohit Goel claimed that despite his commitment to 'Make in India' and 'Start-up India' initiative, he did not get support from the government.

Earlier on April 18, court directed 12 media houses to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh.
New Delhi:
Google and other social media platforms have done a great disservice to the nation by uploading contents which revealed the identity of an eight-year-old girl who was raped and killed in Kathua district of Jammu and Kashmir, the Delhi High Court said Friday.

The court issued notice to social media platforms Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube after their Indian subsidiaries told the bench that they were not the concerned entity to reply to the court's notice on the issue.

""You have done a great disservice to the nation. India has been branded... It is an injustice to the nation and to the victim's family. This kind of publication is not permissible,"" a bench of Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Hari Shankar said.

The bench also said messages and images were circulated on Whatsapp showing India in a bad light. It also observed that the entities cannot absolve themselves for the illegal activities on their websites and the law was the same for everyone.

The court was informed by the counsel for the social media platforms that the court has arrayed as parties the Indian subsidiaries which were not responsible for the contents on the websites and it should make the parent companies a party.

It also asked the counsel for the foreign entities to take instructions as to how much they were willing to deposit to the Jammu and Kashmir Victim Compensation Fund as compensation for the victims. 

The bench also stayed the proceedings initiated by the Press Council of India (PCI) under the Press Council Act against some of the media houses for disclosing the identity of the child victim in the rape case.

PCI has initiated the proceedings on receiving a reference from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting regarding the suo motu cognisance taken by the high court in the Kathua rape case.

The court listed the matter for further hearing on May 29.

It was also informed by one of the counsel that in Srinagar, the child victim's photographs were pasted on autos and buses.

To this, the court said it was conscious of its boundaries and limitations and would pass such orders which could be executed.

The bench had earlier observed that the names or photographs of a sexual abuse victim should not be revealed as such actions have long term ""detrimental consequences"".

It had on April 18 directed 12 media houses to pay a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each for revealing the identity of the minor rape victim. It had also indicated that it may enhance this amount, which has to be deposited in the Jammu and Kashmir Victim Compensation Fund. The media houses had apologised before the court.

Later, the bench added several other media houses and websites and asked them to pay the amount and file their response as to why action be not taken against them for disclosing the identity of the rape victim.

In its news reports connected with the case, The Press Trust of India had not disclosed the name or put out a photograph of the victim.

The court had directed that wide and continuous publicity be given to the statutory provisions of the law regarding the privacy of victims of sexual offences and punishment for revealing their identities.

While Section 23 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act lays down the procedure for the media to report cases of sexual offences against child victims, Section 228A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) deals with disclosure of identity of victims of such offences. The penal law provides for jail term of two years with a fine.

On April 13, the high court had issued notices to 12 media houses andr prohibited all of them ""from effecting any publication including the name, address, photograph, family details, school details, neighbourhood or any other particulars which may have an effect of leading to the disclosure of the identity of the child victim"".

The eight-year-old girl from a minority nomadic community had disappeared from near her home in a village near Kathua in Jammu region on January 10. Her body was found in the same area a week later.

The state police's Crime Branch, which probed the case, filed the main charge sheet against seven persons and a separate charge sheet against a juvenile in a court in Kathua district last week. The charge sheet revealed chilling details about how the girl was allegedly kidnapped, drugged and raped inside a place of worship before being killed.

Men who raped a medical student in Delhi in 2012 had moved Supreme Court against the death sentence.
New Delhi:
Four of the men who gang-raped and tortured a Delhi student on a moving bus in December 2012, leaving the nation scarred forever, asked the Supreme Court to spare them the death sentence as it was ""cold-blooded killing in the name of Justice.""

As the court reserved its verdict, there was no decision today on the convicts' petition challenging their death sentence.

The court today heard two of the killers, Vinay Kumar and Pavan Kumar, who argued that they are ""young and from poor families"". The argument was rebutted by the public prosecutor. Their lawyer AP Singh claimed they were ""not habitual offenders and have no criminal records, so the court must allow them to be reformed.""

Mr Singh also said the death penalty has been abolished in many countries. Execution kills criminals and not the crime, he argued. He also claimed his clients were underage when they were arrested.
 The Nirbhaya rape case in Delhi had sparked huge protests in 2012.
Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra said: ""Death penalty exists in the statute.""

The convicts told the court that there were discrepancies in Nirbhaya's dying statements and she didn't name the accused.

Special Public Prosecutor Sidharth Luthra countered that all their arguments had been considered by the Supreme Court when it confirmed death sentence in May 2017.

The gang-rape and killing of the 23-year-old medical student on December 16, 2012, provoked rage and shock across India and led to big changes to laws on sexual crimes against women.

Of the six accused, bus driver Ram Singh killed himself in his prison cell. The youngest accused, just days short of 18 when he committed the crime, had been sent to a juvenile home.

The woman, who died after 16 days in hospital, came to be known as ""Nirbhaya"" or fearless. Her parents have said that all the rapists should be hanged at the earliest, including the youngest.

In Ghazipur rape case, a Madrasa cleric was arrested last week.
New Delhi:
The accused arrested for the kidnapping and rape of an 11-year-old in Delhi, had not told the truth about his age, medical tests have found. After bone density tests, doctors have said that he is around 20 years old, and not 17 as he had told the police.

The accused, who was kept at a juvenile home near Delhi after his arrest, will now be considered an adult and tried as one, the Juvenile Justice Board has said.

For children in conflict with law, the punishment is lighter, although lately the law has been changed to incorporate a provision for trying juveniles as adults in case of heinous crimes like rape and murder. The Juvenile Justice Board takes a final call on the issue.

The accused was produced at a court in Delhi today, where the police applied for his custody.

The police said the man had kidnapped the girl on April 21, kept her captive at a madrasa in Ghazipur in Delhi, and drugged and raped her overnight.

The child had gone missing while on her way to a local market. After checking CCTV footage from the area and her cellphone records, the police finally tracked her down and rescued her. The accused was arrested a week later.  A cleric was also arrested although his role in the case is yet to be determined.

The rape survivor today told reporters that both the man and the madrasa owner had threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the sexual assault.

""He (main accused) forcefully took me to the madrasa, threatened to kill my family and took my phone. Madrasa owner also threatened me,"" she told reporters.

In Ghazipur rape case, a Madrasa cleric was arrested last week.
Ghazipur (Delhi):
After an 11-year-old girl alleged rape by a teen in Ghazipur madrasa in Delhi, the cleric was arrested last week.  

Recalling the horror, the rape survivor revealed the prime accused took her to the Madrasa by force and threatened to kill her family.

""He (main accused) forcefully took me to the Madrasa, threatened to kill my family and took my phone. Madrasa owner also threatened me,"" said the 11-year-old rape survior.

While speaking to ANI she said that on drinking the water given to her she fell asleep.

""When I woke up the next day, I found that my clothes were wet,"" she added.

The girl had gone missing after she went to the market on April 21. After a case was registered in this regard by her father, the police found a CCTV footage in which the accused was seen taking the girl along with him. After tracking the girl's phone call detail record (CDR), they found her at a madrasa in Ghaziabad. It was found that that a juvenile had kidnapped and raped her.

A case was registered under sections of POCSO (Protection Of Children From Sexual Offences Act) and the teen boy was sent to a juvenile home.
On April 27, police authorities arrested the prime accused, a cleric identified as Ghulam Shahid under POCSO. The cleric, however, claims to be innocent.

Speaking to NDTV, the wife of the accused cleric said, ""My husband has not committed any wrongdoing. He is innocent. He had been teaching at the Madrasa for the last five years. So many young girls passed out and nothing went wrong. It is not possible that the little girl went through all that.""
The girl's family used to stay in Ghaziabad before moving to Ghazipur and had known the accused juvenile, which could be why the girl went with the accused to the madrasa where he studied. The family alleges that the girl has been gang-raped and is demanding action against the juvenile and the cleric.
The case has been transferred to the crime branch for a thorough probe.

BJP National President Amit Shah took a jibe at the Congress over the Jan Akrosh Rally in a series of the tweets. He slammed the Congress chief over 'dynastic politics' in the grand old party.  ""A dynasty and their courtiers, who were sent out of state after state by 'Jan Aadesh' now pretend to represent 'Jan Akrosh.' Today's Congress rally is nothing but a 'Parivar Akrosh Rally' which highlights their increasing irrelevance,"" he tweeted.
During today's 'Parivar Akrosh Rally' you will see abject India-hatred on display. After all, the Congress cannot digest that 125 crore Indians have seen through their anti-development and highly divisive politics. Congress' efforts to create divisions are fully exposed!

If the Congress wants to see 'Jan Akrosh' they should see the results of election after election, where their Party has been comprehensively defeated across the length and breadth of India. People are not tolerating Congress' lies, empty promises, corruption and communalism.

I also hope the Congress President apologizes to the nation for the Party's efforts to trample over every possible institution in the country just because of their power hungry nature. The country is tired of these negative and arm twisting tactics of the Congress.

Jodhpur:
A Rajasthan trial court has held self-styled godman Asaram Bapu guilty of raping a 16-year-old five years ago at his Chhindwara ashram. Massive security has been deployed in Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana and Gujarat ahead of the Jodhpur court decision. The Home Ministry has asked for security to stepped up to ensure that no violence takes place ahead of the Asaram rape case verdict. Prohibitory orders have also been issued in Jodhpur where the trial court will deliver its verdict in the Central Jail premises, as directed by the Rajasthan High Court.

A teenaged girl of Asaram Bapu's Chindwara-based gurukul had accused him of raping her at his ashram near Jodhpur. Following her complaint, Asaram Bapu was arrested by Jodhpur police on August 31, 2013. He is in jail since then.

Asaram rape case verdict: the self-styled godman, if convicted, faces a minimum of 10 years in jail
Jodhpur:
A court in Rajasthan will decide today if self-styled godman Asaram -- who runs 400 ashrams across India -- was guilty of raping a 16-year-old five years ago. Asaram has thousands of followers across India with extensive money and muscle power. The trial in the two cases against him has been marked by a string of attacks against witnesses who dared to testify against him. Even the police and media men said they have been targetted. Jodhpur, where Asaram has been jailed since 2013, has been converted to a fortress to prevent any reprisals from his followers. Similar precautions have been taken in Shahjahanpur of Uttar Pradesh, where the young woman and her family now stay. Besides Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, extensive security arrangements have been made in Delhi and Haryana too.
Here's your 10-point cheatsheet to the Asaram rape case:
Asaram has been accused of rape by a 16-year-old girl. The teen has alleged that her parents were tricked into taking her to his ashram near Jodhpur in 2013. The attendants at Asaram's ashram in Chhindwara, where she was studying, said she was possessed by evil spirits and needed to be exorcised. In Jodhpur, she was sexually assaulted by Asaram, the chargesheet said.  
The chargesheet against Asaram accuses him of rape, trafficking, and under a stringent law on sexual crimes against children that could entail a life term if charges are proved. If convicted, he faces a minimum sentence of 10 years in jail.
The father of the girl has told NDTV that they are waiting for justice. ""My daughter has done her duty. She stood by her testimony throughout the trial,"" he told NDTV. The family also said they were offered money to withdraw the case against Asaram. When they refused, they were threatened.       
Over the last four years since the trial started against him, 9 witnesses in the two cases against Asaram have been attacked. Three of them have died.
Asaram's doctor Amrut Prajapat was shot in Gujarat's Rajkot in June 2014. His cook Akhil Gupta and another key witness, Kripal Singh, were shot dead in 2015 in Uttar Pradesh. Mahendra Chawala and Rahul Sachan, two other witnesses, were attacked on the premises of the Jodhpur court in 2015. They survived and went ahead to depose against Asaram.
Ajay Pal Lamba, the police officer who led the investigation against Asaram in Jodhpur in 2013, said he faced regular threats. ""They tried to influence our team in every way. They would also threaten us,"" said the officer, who is now with the Anti-Corruption Bureau.
Heavy security has been put in place in Jodhpur, where the sentence will be pronounced inside the jail. The police have sealed the entry points to the city, and have evacuated Asaram's ashram. Rail and road traffic are under heavy scrutiny.  The centre has also asked Rajasthan, Gujarat and Haryana governments to tighten security as the three states have a large number of Asaram followers.
The district magistrate of Shahjahanpur said they have also made adequate arrangements for security. ""We are expecting some of his followers might try to come, so we have issued alerts. The adjacent district also on alert,"" Amrit Tripathi told NDTV.
Asaram faces another case in Surat, Gujarat, where two sisters have accused him and his son Narayan Sai of rape and illegal confinement.
Haryana and several other norther states witnessed massive violence last year, when thousands of followers of another self-styled godman, Gurmeet Ram Rahim, went on rampage after he was found guilty of rape. The flamboyant 50-year-old chief of Dera Sacha Sauda - who built an empire worth crores -- was convicted for raping two women 15 years ago. He has been sentenced to 20 years in jail.

The spot where the man allegedly raped the girl was identified from the video
New Delhi:
The family of a 12-year-old girl in west Delhi was horrified by a video they received on WhatsApp last Saturday. The video reportedly showed their child, who is mentally challenged, being raped allegedly by their neighbour the day before. Amid nationwide anger over the recent cases of rapes of children, including the Kathua and the Surat cases, Delhi police arrested three men on Monday.

A young man, identified as Bunty, and two of his friends were arrested on Monday night from Mangolpur Kalan area in Delhi's Rohini suburb. Police said Bunty lured the girl to a community center in their neighbourhood, took her to a secluded spot and raped her. The two friends who accompanied him took a video as he committed the horrific act, police said.

The spot where the man allegedly raped the girl was identified from the video made by his friends.

""Bunty has been booked for rape and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), and his friends under the relevant sections of IPC and the IT Act for their involvement in the crime,"" the police officer said.

The girl's family alleges that they are facing pressure from the family of the accused to withdraw the case.

""Bunty is a powerful person and his other family members have strong hold in the area. They are mounting pressure on us to withdraw rape case against Bunty after his arrest. They are also pressurising us to leave the locality,"" the child's mother was quoted by news agency IANS.   

What triggered the countrywide protests and anger - both on the streets as well as online - over the weekend was when the gruesome details of the kidnapping, gang-rape and murder of an eight-year-old in Kathua in Jammu and Kashmir in January, emerged last week. In Surat, the body of a young girl who was raped, tortured and murdered, was found on April 6. Days later, another child, an eight-year-old girl attending a wedding with her parents was raped and strangled in Uttar Pradesh on Monday.

Police have launched a manhunt to arrest her father, who is on the run. (Representational image)
New Delhi:
A 16-year-old girl has alleged that her parents tried to force her to change her statement in court in favour of the two men accused of raping her in outer Delhi's Aman Vihar area, police said on Monday.

The girl told police that her parents were paid Rs 5 lakh from the accused to force her to change her statement in court, news agency PTI reported.

Based on her statements, police arrested her mother. A manhunt has been launched to arrest her father, who is on the run.

The girl's mother has been sent to judicial custody.

The girl alleged that her parents initially tried to convince her to change statement but started beating her up when she refused to relent.

The 16-year-old girl had gone missing in August last year after which her parents had filed a police complaint. She returned after a week and told police that she was held captive by two men who raped her. The two men were arrested.

According to Delhi Police, more than five rape cases were reported on an average every day in the national capital last year, and in most incidents the accused was known to the victim.

The police claimed that in 96.63 per cent of the rape cases the accused was known to the victim, with friends or family friends being the perpetrators in 38.99 per cent of the cases.

Neighbours were the accused in 19.08 per cent of the cases and relatives were involved in 14.20 per cent of the cases.

Employers or co-workers were the perpetrators in 3.86 per cent of the cases, the statistics said.

CM announced the AAP government would amend the law to secure death penalty for rapists of minor girls.
New Delhi:
The Delhi government today ordered the completion of forensic examinations in cases of crime against women within a month, keeping in view ""the ever-increasing incidents"" of such crimes.

In his order to Principal Secretary (Home) Manoj Parida, Delhi Home Minister Satyendar Jain has asked him to ensure that such cases were given top priority for the earliest completion of prosecution.

The Delhi government's move comes at a time when there is a public outcry over Kathua and Unnao rape cases in the country.

""Keeping in view the ever-increasing incidents of crimes against women/girl/Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) offences, all such cases referred for forensic examination need to be attended urgently for earliest completion of prosecution.

""Accordingly, please ensure that such cases are given top priority and forensic examination is completed within a month,"" Mr Jain said in the order. 

An official said that the government was currently ascertaining the number of pending cases where forensic examination was yet to be completed.

Yesterday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the AAP government would amend the law to secure death penalty for the rapists of minor girls.

While vowing to take the legislative measure during the next assembly session, Mr Kejriwal had also said he would also set up fast-track courts to complete the trial of the cases of crime against women in six months.

The official said that the home department of the government had started working on preparing a proposed Bill to amend the IPC and the CrPC.

The chief minister had also urged citizens to take a day off and support the DCW chief Swati Maliwal in her indefinite hunger strike at Rajghat, demanding stringent laws and the death penalty for rapists.

Karti Chidambaram has been granted interim protection from arrest till May 2.
A Delhi court today granted Karti Chidambaram interim protection from arrest till May 2 in two cases filed by the CBI and ED in the Aircel-Maxis matter arising out of the 2G spectrum cases.

Special Judge O P Saini granted relief to the son of senior Congress leader P Chidambaram after the counsel for the Enforcement Directorate (ED) sought time to argue on Karti Chidambaram's application seeking anticipatory bail.

The submission was supported by the CBI counsel who requested the court to put up the matter for next date.

The court had on March 24 granted interim relief to Karti Chidambaram till today after considering that both the investigative agencies had sought time to file their responses on his anticipatory bail plea.

Karti Chidambaram had filed a plea seeking protection from arrest in the Aircel-Maxis matter, in which the CBI and the ED lodged cases in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

The matter pertains to grant of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance to firm M/S Global Communication Holding Services Ltd for investment in Aircel.

In September, 2015, the CBI had filed its status report regarding a probe into the FIPB approvals in the case. The agency had in June, 2016 also issued notice to A Palaniappan, director of Chess Management Services, a company promoted by Karti Chidambaram.

Kathua, Unnao rape cases: Protests are being held at Bengaluru's Freedom Park
New Delhi:
Demonstrations were held in several cities across India, including Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, Goa and Bhopal on Sunday as public outrage over a spate of rape and murder of children spiral. Over the last two weeks, two cases have shaken the nation. Last Sunday, a 16-year-old, who was allegedly raped by a BJP lawmaker in Unnao, tried to commit suicide outside UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's house. The tipping point was the rape and murder of an 8-year-old in Kathua, where the chargesheet spoke of unspeakable brutality. A third -- the death of a 9-year-old girl in Surat, whose body was covered in over 80 wounds -- emerged on Sunday morning.
Here are the top 10 developments in this big story:
Thousands joined in marches, carrying placards and forming human chains in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Goa,  and across Kerala. Protests were also held in Rajasthan's Ajmer, Gujarat's Surat, Punjab capital Chandigarh, and Bhopal, the capital of Madhya Pradesh.
Nearly 2,000 protesters, including activists who participated in the ""Not In My Name"" protests last year, gathered at Parliament Street in the heart of Delhi. Swati Maliwal, the chief of Delhi Women's Commission, announced a hunger strike.
In Mumbai, a section of Bollywood, including actor Priyanka Chopra and producer Ekta Kapoor asked fans to join the protests, which started at Carter Road in the posh Bandra area. ""Everyone should come. Whatever religion, gender or belief you belong to. For humanity, for justice,"" Ekta Kapoor tweeted.
In an open letter, a group of 49 former civil servants have asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to reach out to the families of the children targeted in Kathua and Unnao and ""seek their forgiveness"".
""The bestiality and the barbarity involved in the rape and murder of an eight year old child shows the depths of depravity that we have sunk into. In post-Independence India, this is our darkest hour and we find the response of our Government, the leaders of our political parties inadequate and feeble,"" the letter read.
The unspeakable rape and murder of the 8-year-old in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua -- who belonged to a nomadic Muslim community -- outraged the country after details were exposed in a police chargesheet.
The child was kidnapped on January 10. Over the next week, she was drugged, starved, repeatedly gangraped and then murdered. A police chargesheet also said before her head was bashed with a stone, one of the assailants - a police officer - had asked the killer to wait so he could rape the child for one last time.
Days before the gory details emerged, another young girl from Unnao had tried to commit suicide outside Uttar Pradesh Chief Minster Yogi Adityanath's house. She said she had been raped by BJP lawmaker Kuldeep Singh Sengar and his brother a year ago.
A day later, her father, who had been mercilessly thrashed for his refusal to withdraw the case, died. The lawmaker's brother was arrested in the case of assault.
The Kathua case became heavily politicised and two BJP ministers from Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's cabinet, who defended the accused, were shunted out.

New Delhi:
Huge protests were held in cities across India, including in New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ajmer after massive outrage over the rape cases involving minors in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua and Uttar Pradesh's Unnao. The protests began today from 5 pm onwards.

Kathua Rape-Murder Case

An 8-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district was kidnapped in January 10, while she was grazing horses. The girl was then sedated, starved and gang-raped by a group of people which included police officers. The girl's head was then bashed with a stone to ensure she died. The Kathua rape-murder case triggered massive controversy after the incident became heavily politicised. Two BJP ministers from Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's cabinet defended the accused and after massive outrage, were forced to resign from the cabinet. The girl's family has now decided to ask the Supreme Court to transfer the trial to another state.

Unnao Rape Case

In Uttar Pradesh's Unnao, a minor girl tried to commit suicide outside Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence last Sunday, after inaction over a complaint in which she alleged that BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar had raped her. The girl's father was then later picked up by the police and assaulted in custody, following which he died.

Kathua Rape: Congress president Rahul Gandhi at the midnight candlelight vigil at India Gate
NEW DELHI:
Congress president Rahul Gandhi was at the heart of the national capital at midnight to demand justice for the young girl gang-raped and killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua and the alleged rape of a teenager in Unnao. Sonia Gandhi and daughter Priyanka Vadra Gandhi joined the protests that are seen to be an effort to put the ruling BJP at the centre and the two states in a spot. The protest brought back memories of the spontaneous waves of protests that slammed India Gate after the Nirbhaya gang-rape five years ago and forced parliament to enact tougher rape laws.
Here are the 10 points on this story:
""Wherever we see, woman and children are getting raped and murdered. We want the government to act. This is a national issue, not a political matter,"" Rahul Gandhi, who was stopped a few metres short of India Gate, told reporters.
Mr Gandhi, 47, said the Beti Bachao (Save the girl child) slogan is good. ""We are telling him (PM Modi) that he should get down to the job, implement it,"" the Congress president said in response to a question, a jab at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Hundreds of people, predominantly Congress workers, had joined the march, responding to Mr Gandhi's call to join him for ""a silent, peaceful, candlelight vigil"" to protest violence against women and demand justice. It wasn't as silent as sister Priyanka Vadra Gandhi would have liked it to be. ""Those who are here to push around people must go home,"" she told some people in the crowd.
""Thousands of men and women stood up to be counted in the battle for justice and to protest the rising acts of violence against girls and women. I thank each and every one of you for your support. It shall not be in vain,"" Rahul Gandhi tweeted.
Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad insisted the march was apolitical but did not hesitate to take a swipe at PM Modi too. ""When the government sleeps, the country's watchman sleeps... the Congress has the responsibility to wake him up,"" Mr Azad said in response to a question on the idea behind the march. That swipe was a reference to PM Modi pitch in 2014 elections to make him the country's ""chowkidar"" (watchman), not PM.
The Congress demanded action against the men accused of raping eight-year-old in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua and the teenage girl from Uttar Pradesh's Unnao whose father died trying to get her justice.
But it was the chilling details of the girl's torture outlined by the police in court that the outrage peaked. The girl was kidnapped on January 10 by a group of men to drive out her Muslim Bakerwal community from a village in Kathua. She was kept sedated and gang-raped repeatedly for days by a group that included police officers. When the police made arrests, a local Hindu group supported by politicians insisted they were being framed due to politics.
Celebrities took the lead, tweeting their horror at the pain that the eight-year-old must have undergone. ""Imagine what goes through the mind of an 8 yr old as she is drugged, held captive, gang raped over days and then murdered. If you don't feel her terror, you are not human,"" said actor-director Farhan Akhtar. If one doesn't demand justice for the girl, they belong to nothing, the actor added. Many others joined him.
The Congress president, who broke his silence on the 8-year-old's death after being called out on social media, wondered how anyone could ""protect the culprits of such evil?"" It is a crime against humanity. It cannot go unpunished, he added.
Union Minister VK Singh is the only senior BJP leader to have roundly condemned  rape and murder of the 8-year-old. We have failed the girl as humans, he said. ""But she will not be denied justice,"" the junior foreign minister tweeted. Many other ministers and BJP leaders evaded comments on the Kathua case.

Kathua rape case: Rahul Gandhi at the midnight candlelight vigil at India Gate
New Delhi:
Congress president Rahul Gandhi and senior party leaders including his mother Sonia Gandhi, led a midnight candlelight vigil to India Gate in New Delhi to demand justice for the eight-year-old girl who was gang-raped and murdered in Jammu and Kashmir and the teenager in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao, who was allegedly raped by a BJP lawmaker last year.

Rahul Gandhi's sister Priyanka Vadra and her husband Robert Vadra were also among hundreds of Congress leaders and workers present at the march to India Gate, which was under a huge security cover.

""We want the government to take action. Wherever we see, woman and children are getting raped and murdered. We want the government to resolve this matter. This is a national matter, not political. It concerns the women of this country. The government should act on the atrocities against the women in the country,"" Rahul Gandhi, 47, told reporters.

Earlier in the evening, Rahul Gandhi had tweeted, asking people to join him for ""a silent, peaceful, candlelight vigil at India Gate at midnight tonight to protest this violence and demand justice.""

During the march, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, saying, ""The government is sleeping and so at this time the Congress will have to wake them up. PM had given a slogan 'Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao' and it is in his regime that our girls are being raped.""

The BJP, condemning the march by the Congress, called it a ""fashion walk."" BJP's Vaibhav Aggarwal said ""people in the march are clicking selfies"".

Breaking his silence on the Kathua case earlier on Thursday, Rahul Gandhi had tweeted, ""How can anyone protect the culprits of such evil? What happened to [her] at #Kathua is a crime against humanity. It cannot go unpunished. What have we become if we allow politics to interfere with such unimaginable brutality perpetrated on an innocent child?""

The Congress president had been called out on social media for not speaking up even as the party's leaders in Jammu appeared to back protests in support of those arrested in the little girls killing.

Earlier in the day, Union Minister VK Singh had also added his voice to the spiraling outrage over the 8-year-old's gang-rape and murder. ""We have failed [her] as humans. But she will not be denied justice,"" tweeted the former army chief, the first minister in the BJP-led central government to talk about justice for the child who suffered unspeakable cruelty in her last few days.

The response of the BJP and the Congress in Jammu and Kashmir has been largely political in what has become the trigger for communal polarisation.

Another union minister Jitendra Singh, who represents a part of Kathua in parliament, had last month said, ""those who have not done anything wrong should be given justice"", backing demands for a CBI inquiry from those who support the arrested men.

The girl was kidnapped when she was grazing horses near her home on January 10, kept sedated and gang-raped repeatedly for days by a group that included police officers. She was drugged and not given food the entire time. Just before her head was bashed in with a rock, one of the police officers asked the killer to wait so he could rape the child one more time, according to the police charge-sheet submitted in court.
 
Among the eight arrested men is a retired revenue department official who planned the crime to instill fear among the Bakherwal nomads - the girl was one of them - and drive them out of the Rassana area. They were a small group of Muslim families living in a Hindu-dominated area.
 Unnao rape case: Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a Uttar Pradesh MLA, has denied that he raped the teenager
In UP's Unnao, a district around 50 km from Lucknow, a 16-year-old girl has accused BJP lawmaker Kuldeep Singh Sengar of raping her in June last year. Though the lawmaker has been charged under a tough law for sexual crimes against children, he will not be arrested just yet. ""Why should we arrest him? We have mentioned his name in the FIR (First Information Report). Now CBI can take over the investigation,"" said the police chief.

All this week, Kuldeep Singh Sengar has strutted around denying the accusation, disparaging the girl and her family and hitting out at the media. During that time, his brother Atul Singh was arrested for a brutal assault on the girl's father, who was not just arrested with severe wounds on his body but who died on Monday in custody.

More than 10,000 people participated in the peaceful demonstration, according to the DCW. (PTI)
New Delhi:
Thousands of people today formed a human chain around Central Park in Delhi's Connaught Place area to protest the increasing number of rape cases and raise awareness about the issue, the Delhi Commission of Women said.

The human chain was formed as part of the DCW's ""Rape Roko"" campaign, which it had launched after the brutal rape of an eight-month-old baby in January. Since then, the commission has been staging programmes to raise awareness on the issue.

On Tuesday, male volunteers of the campaign walked the streets in Delhi wearing only boxer shorts to send out the message that ""clothes do not cause rape, sick mentality does"".

Today, more than 10,000 people participated in the peaceful demonstration, demanding the completion of trial in child rape cases within six months and death penalty for the accused in rape cases, according to a DCW statement.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who attended the event, said the Delhi government will make every effort to ensure the safety of women in the national capital. He said he is working to develop a curriculum in schools to ensure a change in the mindset in children.

Wrestler Yogeshwar Dutt, singer Caralisa Monteiro and actor Luke Kenny participated in the human chain along with DCW chief Swati Maliwal and other men, women and children.

A ""Rape Roko"" video song composed by Caralisa Monteiro and featuring Farhan Akhtar, Shankar Mahadevan, Anushka Manchanda, Mahalaxmi Iyer and others was also released at the event, the statement stated.

Mr Dutt and Mr Kenny urged people to raise their voice against rapes.

Yesterday, Ms Maliwal alleged that she was manhandled along with other representatives when they were marching towards the Prime Minister's Office to submit 5.55 lakh letters, which it had received from across India as part of its campaign.

Ms Maliwal urged the prime minister to listen to the ""Mann Ki Baat"" of the people of the country, who demand strict action against child rapists.

The court has directed investigators to file their reply by March 20 in NRI woman's rape case. (File)
New Delhi:
A 32-year-old NRI woman, who was allegedly raped by a businessman in Delhi, has moved the Delhi High Court, seeking transfer of her case to the crime branch of the city police.

The high court has issued notice to the Delhi Police and sought their stand on the woman's plea. It also directed the investigators to file their reply by March 20.

The woman has alleged that she was raped by one Vishal Chawla on the night of September 28, 2017 while she was with him to discuss about business opportunities in India.

The woman in her petition filed through her counsel said that she came to India in September along with her husband to explore business opportunities.

As per the plea, she came in contact with the accused who claimed to be a business associate and assured them of extending help.

On the night of the incident, while her husband was away, the man came to her hotel and took the woman to his residence to discuss the business proposals, the plea states. It further said that the man served her drinks and later raped her.

The petition further states that the accused threaded her of dire consequences, if she disclosed the incident to anyone.

The woman and her husband, however, approached the police and lodged a rape case against the accused.

The plea stated that when the couple went to the police station to enquire about the FIR lodged against the accused, they found that the man was present there and he threatened to kill them.

""In this situation, the couple immediately left India and went back to New Zealand,"" the plea said.

It further stated that till date neither the accused has been arrested nor any progress made in the probe.

""The woman is seeking justice for herself and proper punishment to the offender especially in view of the collusion of the police officials with the accused, as the same is essential for securing dignity and human life to the woman,"" the plea said.

It said in the present circumstances, the probe into the matter should be transferred from the Delhi Police to its Crime Branch to ensure speedy and fair investigation of the case.

The victim had to be fitted with a colostomy bag after the attack (File)
New Delhi:
A eight-month-old girl raped in Delhi has suffered internal injuries, a leading rights campaigner said on Wednesday, as she launched a 30-day protest to demand the death penalty for child rapists.

Swati Maliwal, who heads the Delhi Commission for Women, visited the infant in hospital after the attack and has urged a change in the law to deter such attacks in the city known as the country's rape capital.

The victim had to be fitted with a colostomy bag after the attack, which occurred while her mother was out at work.

""She has gone through immense pain, her internal organs have been damaged. They will take a long time to heal,"" Ms Maliwal told AFP.

""She's just so small. It's horrific what she's gone through.""

Supreme Court dispatched two doctors to check on the child's welfare on Wednesday after a lawyer filed a public interest petition asking it to intervene in her case.

Ms Maliwal announced a month-long protest to urge tougher laws in the country; India has some of the world's highest rates of sexual violence against children.

""People are just fed up with the system, they feel there's no hope. They don't know how to express their anger any more,"" she said.

""I will work day and night to ensure a safer environment for women and to force the government to listen to our demand for death penalty at least for all child rapists.""

Police investigating the latest attack say they have charged the girl's 27-year-old cousin after he confessed to the crime.

But Ms Maliwal said delays in delivering justice was a key reason why high levels of sexual violence against women persisted.

""The fact is that an eight-month old baby has been raped. The doctors have given that testimony,"" she said, demanding the death penalty.

""There is no other way of creating a deterrence in the society because currently there is no fear of the law.""

The victim's parents, impoverished daily wage labourers, have also called for the death penalty. Under the law the maximum sentence for rape is life imprisonment.

The country has a horrifying record of sexual crimes against women, with nearly 39,000 rape cases reported in 2016, according to government data.

A UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2014 said one in three rape victims in the country was a minor and expressed alarm over the widespread sexual abuse of children.

Nearly 11,000 cases of child rape were reported in India in 2015, according to the National Crime Records Bureau's latest figures.

It said three children were raped every day in Delhi alone.

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Delhi in 2012 to demand government action after the fatal gang-rape of a young student.

The government responded by introducing tougher laws and setting up fast-track courts to try rape cases, but rights campaigners say implementation is patchy.

Supreme Court rejects challenge to Peepli Live director Mahmood Farooqui's acquittal in rape case
New Delhi:
Rejecting a petition challenging the acquittal of Peepli Live director Mahmood Farooqui, the Supreme Court today upheld the verdict of the Delhi High Court. ""It is not a case where strangers met. It is a relationship and they were known to each other,"" the top court said, adding that ""it's a hard case but well decided by the high court"".  

Vrinda Grover, the petitioner's lawyer, argued that her client and Mr Farooqui were ""good friends"" and that there was no ""consensual sex"". 

Pointing to an email sent by the complainant to Mr Farooqui two days after the alleged rape in which she wrote ""I love you"", the court asked Ms Grover, ""You have argued many cases. In how many cases after the incident the victim says - I love you?"". The petitioner trusted his friend and they were known to each other, replied Ms Grover.

Replying to the court's query on how many times the petitioner had met Mr Farooqui and had drinks with him, Ms Grover said, ""maybe twice, and on one instance they exchanged kisses"".  

Refusing to interfere with the high court, a bench of Justices S A Bobde and L Nageswara Rao said, ""It's a hard case but well decided by the high court"".

Mr Farooqui was booked in 2015 on the complaint filed by a 30-year-old research scholar from a US-based university. The petitioner had alleged that Mr Farooqui raped her at his south Delhi residence. In 2016, a trial court convicted the filmmaker of rape and sentenced him to seven years of rigorous imprisonment besides imposing a fine of Rs 50,000.  

Mr Farooqui challenged the order in the Delhi High Court that acquitted him in September last year, giving him the 'benefit of doubt'. ""It would be really difficult to decipher whether little or no resistance and a feeble ""no"" was actually a denial of consent,"" the high court order said.  The complainant then moved Supreme Court, saying there was enough evidence against Farooqui.

Faridabad gang-rape: The men dumped her near a petrol pump in Sikri, 20 km from where they picked her.
Faridabad:
A 22-year-old woman, who was returning home from work on last evening, was kidnapped and gang-raped allegedly by four men in a moving car for nearly two hours in Haryana's Faridabad. They later dumped her near Ballabhgarh. No arrests have been made so far, Pooja Dabla, head of the Special Investigation Team (SIT) that is investigating the case, said.

According to police, the incident took place around 6.30 pm when a few men in a sports utility vehicle (SUV) forcibly pulled her into the vehicle and took turns to rape her. 

The woman has bruises all over her body, a crime branch officer said. A medical test has confirmed rape following which the police registered an FIR against unknown persons.

On Saturday, the half-naked body of a 15-year-old girl, who had been missing for a week, was found with her liver and lungs ruptured in Jind, about 175 km from Faridabad.

""Her private parts were mutilated and there were lot of internal injuries. Signs of sexual assault are visible and looks like three-four people were responsible, a hard and blunt thing was inserted inside her, signs of drowning also found,"" said Dr SK Dattarwal at PGI Rohtak.

Haryana Chief Minister ML Khattar said one of the attackers has been identified and would be arrested soon.

The body of another girl, 11, was found in a village in Panipat on Sunday, the police said. The girl was allegedly kidnapped on Saturday evening when she had left her house to throw garbage in the village dump. She was raped and strangled, the police said.

The number of reported rape cases reduced from 2,064 in 2016 to 2,049 in 2017
New Delhi:
More than five rape cases were reported on an average every day in the national capital last year, and in most incidents the accused was known to the victim, according to Delhi Police data.

However, the number of reported rape cases reduced from 2,064 in 2016 to 2,049 in 2017.

As many as 3,273 molestation cases were reported last year in comparison to 4,035 in 2016, according to the statistics shared by Delhi Police.

The cases of eve-teasing declined from 894 in 2016 to 621 last year, it said.

Almost 92 per cent of the rape cases were solved as opposed to 86 per cent in 2016, the statistics said.

Eighty three per cent of the molestation cases were worked out in 2017 as compared to 72 per cent in 2016.

Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik said that a host of initiatives were taken for women's safety as it was a priority focus area for them.

""Under the banner of 'Sashakti', extensive self-defence training was imparted by our trainers and around 2 lakh girls were covered in 2017,"" he said.

Some of the other initiatives included ensuring high visibility of police personnel in vulnerable areas, introduction of women patrols and making the 'Himmat' app bilingual and more user-friendly, the police chief said.

He attributed the decrease in the crimes against women to these initiatives.

The police also kept a constant liaison with civic authorities apprising them of the dark and lonely stretches in the city.

The district police took strict action against drinking in public places, which often acts as a precursor to crime against women, with as many as 23,094 people being arrested for the offence, the police said.

The police claimed that in 96.63 per cent of the rape cases the accused was known to the victim, with friends or family friends being the perpetrators in 38.99 per cent of the cases.

Neighbours were the accused in 19.08 per cent of the cases and relatives were involved in 14.20 per cent of the cases.

Employers or co-workers were the perpetrators in 3.86 per cent of the cases, the statistics said.

Nirbhaya's mother, Asha Devi, has launched a foundation to help crime survivors
New Delhi:
In the months and years when her daughter died after suffering for 10 days, Asha Devi still had a lingering hope: That Nirbhaya's pain wouldn't go in vain. India had upgraded its laws for crimes against women, the Union government promised more boots on the ground and the city government, a rule that no bus could operate in the national capital without a CCTV.

""But today too we are standing where we were, in 2012,"" she said.

Five years ago, her 23-year-old daughter caught a bus home from the cinema after watching Life of Pi with a friend on 16 December 2012. There were all of six people in the bus including the bus driver. It started with abuses and assault. Over the next hour or so, her friend was beaten with an iron rod as he she was gang-raped. And because she had protested, an iron rod was also pushed into her that even severely damaged her intestines.

The barbaric attack drew spontaneous protests across the country, and public pressure forced the government to start fixing the criminal justice system and make the country safer for women.

""They said CCTV cameras will be put in buses. But they haven't been put... Whatever was promised, said, remained just that, a promise,"" said Asha Devi with a sense of disappointment and anger. Reported crimes against women haven't dropped either and the police, notwithstanding a law that makes it a crime for policemen not to register cases, are often far from prompt.

In neighbouring Uttar Pradesh's Banda district, a 21-year-old who had been complaining about a man stalking her, killed herself this week. Her family says the police hadn't acted on their complaint. 
About 300 km away, three men who had been raping a minor girl for two months set her afire after she complained to the police.

And one in three crimes against women in all metro cities are still reported from Delhi.

""Crimes that are still happening against women,"" Nirbhaya's mother said. Except for the occasional remarks from politicians and government when they are prodded, ""No one has said a word about them in these five years on their own or did anything,"" Asha Devi added.

With governments less than enthusiastic to make a change, Asha Devi this year decided to chip in and launched a foundation to help crime survivors. ""This gives me purpose and solace. I know I won't get my daughter back but I began this foundation to help others raise their voice so that others don't go through the same thing,"" she told NDTV this week.

The review petition was filed by convicts Vinay Sharma and Pawan Kumar Gupta (File)
New Delhi:
Two of the four death row convicts in the December 16, 2012 gangrape and murder case today moved the Supreme Court for review of its verdict upholding the capital punishment awarded to them.

The review petition by convicts Vinay Sharma and Pawan Kumar Gupta came after the top court on December 12 completed the hearing on the review plea filed by another death row convict Mukesh.

A 23-year-old paramedic student was gang raped on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 inside a moving bus in South Delhi by a gang of six persons and severely assaulted before being thrown out naked. She succumbed to her injuries on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

The review plea, filed through advocate AP Singh for two of the convicts, claimed that death penalty was a premeditated and ""cold blooded killing"" of a human being by the state in the name of justice.

It said the investigation in the matter was not only flawed but also unreliable as many facts of the investigation pertain to recording of the dying declaration of the victim.

The top court had on December 12 allowed the counsel to file review petition for another convict Akshay Singh and listed the matter for hearing on January 22.

The top court had on May 5 upheld the death penalty to the four convicts - Mukesh, 29, Pawan,22, Vinay Sharma, 23 and Akshay Kumar Singh, 31, saying the ""brutal, barbaric and diabolic nature"" of the crime could create a ""tsunami of shock"" to destroy a civilised society.

Another accused in the case, Ram Singh, had allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail, while a convicted juvenile has come out of the reformation home after serving a three- year term.

Kopardi murder case: 3 get death sentence for gang-rape and murder of Maharashtra teen
New Delhi:
Three convicts were sentenced to death by a special court today in Maharashtra's Kopardi rape and murder case. Observing the barbarity involved in the murder, this case has been compared by many to the 2012 Delhi gang-rape. The gruesome Kopardi rape and murder triggered massive outrage and protests across Maharashtra. The three culprits in the case - Jitendra Babulal Shinde, 26, Santosh Gorakh Bhawal, 30, and Nitin Gopinath Bhailume, 28 - were held guilty of rape, murder and conspiracy last week and were today punished to be hanged till death. Here's the background of the case:

In July last year, a 15-year-old girl in Maharashtra's Kopardi was murdered after gang-rape by three men. She was so brutally tortured that her hair had been pulled out, her limbs and teeth had been broken and there were bite marks on her body.

Since the victim, a Class 9 student, belonged to the Maratha community, silent marches were taken up by the Marathas across the state against the three culprits who belonged to the Dalit community. Through these marches, they demanded a quick investigation and a speedy trial in the case.

The case had also rocked the Maharashtra Assembly during the Monsoon Session. Following this, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis had said the accused have been arrested and the matter will be heard in a fast-track court.

Following the state-wide protests, the Maharashtra government also appointed noted criminal lawyer Ujjwal Nikam, who has appeared in several high-profile cases including the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack, as the special public prosecutor in the case.

On October 7 last year, the Ahmednagar Police filed the charge sheet running into over 350 pages before the court in which the three men were charged under IPC sections 302 (murder), 376 (rape), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Mr Nikam had earlier told the court that four to five days before the incident, the accused had stopped the girl and tried to molest her. After she resisted, two of the accused said that they would see her later.

On the day of the incident, the accused were moving on their motorcycles and keeping a watch on the girl's movements, Mr Nikam had said.

The three convicts were also given life imprisonment for charges pertaining to rape and criminal conspiracy and they were also fined Rs 20,000 each. The convicts were also given three years' rigorous imprisonment under the charges of molestation.

All these sentences will run concurrently, said Mr Nikam.

Sexual assault was confirmed by the child's pediatrician and a hospital.
New Delhi:
A four-year-old girl was assaulted twice by her classmate in a Delhi school with a ""sharpened pencil"" and his finger, and no teacher was around to prevent the attack that left the child ""writhing in pain"" and badly wounded, her mother has told NDTV.

Three days after the assault on Friday, the Maxfort School told the parents it was safe for them to send their daughter again as the boy's section had been changed.

Accused of extraordinary negligence, the school today doubted the allegations against the boy and said: ""We have no clarity if it took place or not. We feel it is impossible that this incident can take place.""

The police have filed a case against the five-year-old boy but are consulting experts as a child below seven cannot legally be held responsible for any crime.

The mother has shared details of the assault ""in the washroom and then in the classroom"". Her daughter, she says, came home in great pain and ""somehow bore it"".

""(My daughter says)... the boy had just finished eating his food, he had not washed his hands and then touched her private parts. In the washroom, there was no Didi who could help her; in the classroom, her class teacher was not around, and here child says he sharpened his pencil and put it in too,"" the mother writes in a most disturbing account.

""At night, just before going off to sleep, she started crying profusely. She narrated an incident that left me aghast. She told me what another boy in her class had done to her. She cried a lot and went on the look for an ointment that I usually apply when they are hurt, Arnica. When I opened her bloomers and saw the injury, I was shocked. The signs of assault were visible as her private part was red and swollen, and when I applied ointment to it, she started crying all the more in pain,"" she writes.
 In September, Pradyuman Thakur, 7, was found murdered in toilet of Ryan International school
Sexual assault was confirmed by the child's pediatrician and a hospital.

But the school says the boy is not seen entering the washroom in the security footage.

""It is clearly seen on CCTV footage that the boy has not entered the washroom,"" said the school's lawyer NB Joshi. ""The little girl looks happy in the CCTV footage and nothing out of the ordinary appears to have happened on the 17th with her,"" he said.

The mother says CCTV footage corroborates the girl's version as it showed that she was the last to come out of the classroom and there was no teacher or attendant around.

The incident has generated waves of shock nearly three months after  a seven-year-old boy, Pradyuman Thakur, was found murdered in the toilet of Ryan International school in Gurgaon.

The school girl reportedly said that a boy in her class used a finger to assault her. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A four-year-old boy has been accused of sexually assaulting his classmate with a pencil at a school in Delhi's Dwarka. The police have registered a rape case, but they are reportedly consulting legal experts on how to proceed against such a young accused; a child below seven cannot be charged under law.

The parents of the girl have alleged in their complaint to the police that after returning from school on Friday last, she complained of pain in her private parts. The child told her mother that a boy in her class ""opened her pants and put his finger inside"". She also said the boy ""sharpened his pencil and put it in too"".

The boy allegedly kept hurting her because no ""didi or teacher"" was around at the time.

The parents have accused the school management of negligence and have also alleged that the principal, a teacher and a coordinator offered no help after learning of the incident. They also refused to reveal details of the accused student, the parents have complained.

The girl's parents went to the police reportedly after doctors confirmed sexual assault.

The police have filed a case of rape but are believed to be carefully debating the next step, since the minimum age of criminal responsibility - or when a person can be held responsible for a crime - is seven.

Dependra Pathak, the Delhi Police chief spokesperson, told reporters: ""The Indian Penal Code provides children below seven years of age certain protections against prosecutions. We are examining those provisions even as we are handling the matter with the highest degree of sensitivity.""

The girl's parents have alleged that the classroom and a washroom where the assault allegedly took place had been left unattended in violation of rules.

In the Mahmood Farooqi case, Delhi High Court said consent should be expressed in ""clear terms"" (File)
New Delhi:
Consent to any sexual advances does not come from a mere hesitation, reluctance or a ""no"", it has to be ""an affirmative one in clear terms"", the Delhi High Court today said while acquitting filmmaker Mahmood Farooqui in a rape case involving a US researcher.

The High Court said in today's scenario, it was expected that consent be viewed as a clear and unambiguous agreement, expressed outwardly through mutually understandable words or actions and the consent can be withdrawn by either party at any point of time.

""Normally, body language or a non-verbal communication or any previous activity or passivity and in some cases incapacitation because of alcohol consumption, may not be taken as consent.

""However, in the present case, as has been stated, the appellant (Farooqui) has not been communicated or at least it is not known whether he has been communicated that there was no consent of the prosecutrix,"" Justice Ashutosh Kumar said.

""Peepli Live"" co-director Farooqui was acquitted by the High Court saying it remained doubtful whether any such incident took place.

It gave benefit of doubt to him and set aside the trial court order that had awarded a seven-year jail term to Mr Farooqui after convicting him for the alleged rape of a 30- year-old American researcher at his south Delhi residence in March 2015.

The court further said the relationship extended beyond a normal friendship or a relationship between a guide and a researcher.

""True it is that such past conduct will definitely not amount to consent for what happened on the night of March 28, 2015, if at all it had happened, as for every sexual act, everytime, consent is a must. The consent does not merely mean hesitation or reluctance or a 'No' to any sexual advances but has to be an affirmative one in clear terms,"" it said.

It also referred to provision of rape under the IPC in which it has been added that a woman who does not physically resist an act of rape shall not by that reason only be regarded as having consented to such sexual activity.

Honeypreet Insan Moves Delhi High Court For Anticipatory Bail

Ram Rahim's adopted daughter Honeypreet Insan tops the list of most wanted people in Haryana.
New Delhi:
Honeypreet Insan, who has been on the run following the conviction of Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh in two rape cases, today approached the Delhi High Court seeking transit anticipatory bail, her lawyer said.

Priyanka Taneja alias Honeypreet, the adopted daughter of the jailed Dera chief, tops the list of 43 persons 'wanted' by the Haryana Police in connection with incidents of violence that had followed Ram Rahim's conviction in the rape cases.

Earlier, a lookout notice was issued against Honeypreet by the police.

Her lawyer Pradeep Kumar Arya told PTI that they have filed the anticipatory bail petition in the Delhi High Court and the matter would be mentioned tomorrow before a bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal for early hearing.

Ram Rahim was convicted by the special CBI court in Panchkula on August 25, following which violence and arson had erupted in Panchkula and Sirsa districts of Haryana which had left 41 people dead and several others injured.

The CBI court on August 28 had sentenced Ram Rahim to 20 years in prison for raping two of his disciples in 2002.

Honeypreet had accompanied the Dera head when he had come to the special CBI court on August 25. She had also travelled along with him in the special chopper which ferried them to Rohtak from Panchkula after the conviction.

The controversial sect head is currently lodged in Sunaria jail in Rohtak district of Haryana.

Several teams of Haryana Police have travelled across the country, including the Indo-Nepal border, to trace the whereabouts of Honeypreet.

Ram Rahim too today had moved the Punjab and Haryana High Court challenging the trial court's verdict.

In April 2002, an anonymous letter was written to the then chief justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, complaining about the alleged sexual exploitation of women followers at the Dera Sacha Sauda headquarters in Sirsa.

In May 2002, the high court had directed Sirsa district and session judge to probe the allegations in the letter. In September 2002, the high court handed over the matter to the CBI after the district court indicated the possibility of sexual exploitation.

In December 2002, the CBI registered a case of rape, criminal intimidation against Ram Rahim.

The CBI had filed a charge sheet against the Dera head in Ambala court in July 2007. The charge sheet mentioned the sexual exploitation of two 'sadhvis' between 1999 and 2001.

In September 2008, the special CBI court framed charges of rape and criminal intimidation against Ram Rahim.

The woman claimed that she had lodged a false complaint out of anger, police said. (Representational)
Noida:
A woman alleged she was abducted from Noida, gang-raped in a moving car and then dumped in Delhi but hours later did a volte-face saying she had lodged a false complaint out of anger, police said.

Earlier, a case of gang rape was registered at the sector 39 police station in Noida on the basis of the woman's complaint. Noida Police PRO Manish Saxena in a statement claimed that the woman gave it in writing that she had lodged a false case. However, the police are investigating all aspects to bring out the truth, he added.

Mr Saxena said that the woman had lodged FIR at 2.50 am today.

The investigating officer sent her for medical examination but she went home without the medical check up, the police claimed. She was again brought to the hospital for medical examination. She again refused medical examination and gave it to doctors in writing that she did not want herself examined, the police said.

Mr Saxena said that the woman also gave a letter to the police stating she had lodged a ""false gang rape case against two persons out of anger"" and that she did not want any action in the case.

The woman also said that she had not been sexually assaulted, he added.

Initial investigations indicate the case to be false, Mr Saxena said but added that the police was probing the matter in detail to bring out truth as the women may have reversed her version out of fear.

Earlier, the woman had alleged that she was waiting for a cab near the Golf Course metro station when a Scorpio car stopped near her and its occupants on the pretext of asking directions abducted her, police officials said.

The men allegedly raped her and then dumped her near the Akshardham temple in Delhi, she had alleged according to the police officials.

The police did not inform them about the progress in the rape trial or investigation, the women said.
New Delhi:
Six mothers whose children have been raped have gone to court with the basic demand of being informed about the progress in the cases. Not only were they not told about the hearing dates, they were not even informed that the accused were given bail. Two mothers told the Delhi High Court that they found out about the bail only when they saw the men who raped their children roaming free.

The lawyers working on the cases say under the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act or POCSO, the police must keep the parents informed at every stage of investigation and trial and also supply them with a copy of the chargesheet. ""Neither of these two is happening,"" said Sridevi Panikkar, who is representing the children.
Sridevi is part of iProbono's panel of lawyers. iProbono provides access to justice for marginalised and disadvantaged litigants and has provided legal assistance to children who've suffered sexual abuse, to street vendors, and to homeless communities.
The mother of a 14-year-old says the accused received a copy of the chargesheet four months before she got the same document, that too after appeals through her counsel. By then, seven hearings had taken place, which they had missed.

""I found out the man was out on bail when his family came and offered us money to drop the case. He lives next door and now he makes fun of us. We were not informed about the bail by the court, the police or anybody else,"" she said.

Her daughter, who is speech and hearing impaired, was taken home by the man and photographed. ""I don't want push her to tell me what happened because once she slit her wrist,"" her mother said. The girl, who had been raped multiple times, gave birth to a baby, which was given up for adoption.

""We want justice. We are fighting so this does not happen to any other child. My child is not the same anymore. They even tried to get him thrown out of school,"" said the mother of a 10-year-old boy. The family did not receive any updates from the police and found out that the accused got bail only when he showed up in the neighbourhood.

""There are many more such cases... More than 300 such cases under POCSO are being supported by Haq,"" said Sana Siddiqui of the non-profit Haq, which is working to help the families.

Such families mostly come from under-privileged classes and because of the stigma attached to child sex abuse, they do not usually come forward. The non-profit has brought together these six mothers to give much more weight to their appeal.

The High Court has issued a notice to the government, seeking response on the issue. The next hearing is on October 11.

The police are questioning the hotel employees to identify the accused.
New Delhi:
A nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a man in central Delhi's Karol Bagh when she had gone to get food from a hotel in the area, the police said on Wednesday.

The accused is yet to be identified, they said.

The girl's family claimed that the accused tried to strangulate her and left her as he assumed her to be dead.

However, the police said that this angle has not emerged in their investigation so far.

The incident was reported on Tuesday night.

The girl's family alleged that she had gone to the hotel to get food. She was told by the hotel owner that her order would take some time. She went and lay down on a bench. At that time, a man, who had come to the hotel, lured her on some pretext and took her with him to the stairs outside the hotel, the police said. He allegedly forced himself on her, they added.

Her family alleged that he tried to strangulate her and after she lost consciousness, he left her assuming her to be dead.

After she regained consciousness, she returned home and narrated her ordeal, following which the police were informed.

She was taken to a hospital and was later discharged. She is currently undergoing counselling, police said.

The police are questioning the hotel employees to identify the accused.

According to the police, the girl stays with her mother and two siblings in a rented accommodation. Her father had died sometime back.

Mumbai:
An elderly woman seeks a Mills & Boon romance with her swimming coach in Hindi film, Lipstick Under My Burqa, that battled the Indian censors ahead of its release in theatres last month and is now going strong on streaming service Amazon Prime.

In another Bollywood film this year, Anaarkali of Aarah, inspired by a real-life incident, a nautch girl who sings innuendo-laden songs at functions in a small town called Aarah takes on a powerful official who molests her in public.

A fresh crop of Hindi films - or Bollywood as the industry is popularly known - are telling stories of ordinary women seeking sexual and financial freedom, or tackling tags of being ""available"" because they are in the company of men or are out until late.

""Bollywood is a male-dominated industry but there is a sudden influx of women-oriented films that are also doing well,"" Avinash Das, writer-director of Anaarkali of Aarah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Triggering the change in Bollywood's narrative was the brutal gang rape of a 23-year-old woman on a bus in New Delhi in 2012, that led to massive protests across the country and put a spotlight on women's safety in India.

""After the Delhi gang rape case, people are taking note of these films. Such films were made in the past too, but after the protests following the 2012 case, people are alert, and no longer casual about these stories.""

Bollywood films, often characterised by their song and dance sequences and male-dominated story lines are influential in India and beyond, and objectification of women and their use in titillating songs is often blamed for stoking sexual crime in the country.

India has only 10 cinema screens per million people as against 124 in the United States and 90 in China for the nearly 1,000 films Bollywood churns out every year, but it has the largest number of people going to the cinema.

The films that tell women's stories, though still perceived as commercially unviable, have done well at the box office.

Alankrita Shrivastava, director of Lipstick Under My Burqa said viewers were drawn to her film as ""an honest story about them"" and that the film remains the most watched since Amazon Prime's launch in India last December.

The makers of Anaarkali too could prove naysayers wrong when the film did commercially well and even a movie exploring lack of sanitation as a women's rights violation - Toilet: A Love Story - has been a major hit this year.

""When issues matter to people ... they are bound to come into popular entertainment media,"" said veteran filmmaker Shyam Benegal, whose award-winning films explored India's caste divide and told stories of ordinary women.

""Films like Toilet: A Love Story ring a bell with a large section of the audience who identity with the problem and that explains why they are doing well.""

OFF SCREEN VOICES

In April, popular actor Abhay Deol took on fellow actors for endorsing skin whitening creams and slammed the popular Indian belief of ""fairer is better"" as racist.

This off-screen voice of leading actors is creating awareness on subjects that were never discussed, be it fairness creams or even sex trafficking, campaigners said.

""Celebrities have a huge following and the message goes out to people that campaigners would never be able to reach out to,"" said Samarth Pathak, spokesman at United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

Pathak interviewed Bollywood heartthrob John Abraham on World Day Against Trafficking in July where he described trafficking as a ""serious threat to humanity"".

""This was our first interview with a filmstar and it created quite a buzz. A lot of young people are reaching out on (to understand) trafficking, which is unprecedented,"" Pathak said.

A couple of days before the interview, Bollywood's most sought-after actor Akshay Kumar, who plays the male lead in 'Toilet...' and is now working in a film on menstrual hygiene, spoke about the need to protect children from abuse at an international sex trafficking conference in Mumbai.

These star voices matter as Bollywood's handling of prostitution had been restricted to portraying women as ""call girls"" without delving into the problems of sex trafficking and modern day slavery, said Sanjay Macwan, regional director of anti-trafficking charity International Justice Mission.

""When Bollywood celebrities speak against sex trafficking, exploitation and bonded labour, it brings the issue before every Indian.""

'FASHIONABLE AGAIN'

Last year's release Dangal, which shows an ageing father train his two daughters to become wrestlers, defying social norms in conservative Haryana state in northern India, is among Bollywood's biggest ever hits, beating fluffy romances and epic revenge dramas in box office collections.

While arthouse films in the 1980s and a crop of independent filmmakers have tackled social issues, gender and small town India in their films, the backing of such projects by major studios seems a recent phenomenon - but in some ways is simply following an old Bollywood tradition.

""Hindi cinema has been dealing with social issues since the 1920s, even in the silent era,"" Meenakshi Shedde, South Asia consultant to the Berlin and Dubai Film Festivals and festival curator told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

A 1937 film - Duniya Na Mane (The World Does Not Agree) - that showed a young schoolteacher from a poor family refusing to consummate her marriage with an old man.

Some of India's most successful filmmakers from the 1930s to 60s such as V Shantaram and Bimal Roy had social themes at the centre of their stories.

""Bollywood is often perceived as monolithic, masala films with stars, six songs and a happy ending. But it is many different things,"" Shedde said. It is wonderful that social issues are becoming fashionable in Bollywood again.""

On Friday, as followers of Ram Rahim erupted in violence in Haryana's Panchkula, where the chief of the Dera Sacha Sauda sect was convicted by a trial court, and other places in the state, there were incidents of arson in Delhi too, with a few buses and empty train coaches being burnt. 

The police have stepped security in Delhi ahead of today's sentencing and are keeping a close watch on the capital's borders.  

The 50-year-old Dera chief has been found guilty of raping two women followers 15 years ago. The judge who convicted Ram Rahim on Friday will fly to Rohtak jail today to sentence the Dera chief, who is being held at the Sunaria  prison about 10 km away from the main city.

Violence broke out yesterday after Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was convicted in a rape case (AFP)
Chandigarh:
Criticising Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar for allegedly ""protecting and extending political patronage"" to self-styled godman and rape convict Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, the Punjab and Haryana High Court today told the state government to file a case against those who instigated the large-scale violence in parts of Haryana, Punjab and New Delhi.

The high court told the state to verify a newspaper report on alleged instigation by leaders of the Dera Sacha Sauda sect, and file a police complaint against the instigators ""if the reporter stood by his report"".

A high court bench of Justices SS Saron, Surya Kant and Avneesh Jhingan, in its resumed hearing, asked the state about its plans to sanitise the Dera Sacha Sauda at Sirsa town, some 260 kilometres from Chandigarh, where hundreds of followers are reportedly still inside.

Getting tough, the judges criticised Haryana Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma for recently granting Rs 51 lakh to the sect.

The judges told the Deputy Commissioners of Punjab and Haryana to provide a list of the sect's properties and not to sell or transfer the assets, besides seeking a report on the violence.

A Central Bureau of Investigation court in Haryana's Panchkula town, adjoining Chandigarh, yesterday held Ram Rahim guilty of raping two women followers in 2002, sparking violent protest by his followers. The security forces opened fire to control the mob.

Thirty-one people, 29 of them in Panchkula, died while 250 others were injured.

Violence erupted after Dera chief Ram Rahim's conviction in rape case by Haryana court
New Delhi:
The Delhi Transport Corporation has suspended its inter-state, night and the Delhi-Lahore bus services in wake of the violence after self-style godman Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was convicted in a rape case on Friday.

A DTC official said the services have been suspended also because buses were being targeted in arson and violence in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi.

""The Delhi-Lahore bus service have been suspended because it passes through violence hit Haryana and Punjab,"" he said.

DTC spokesperson Sanjay Saxena said the Delhi-Lahore bus services remained suspended on Friday as well. DTC's night services-- wherein around 40 buses are run from 9 pm onwards-- have also been suspended, he said.

A decision to resume the services will be taken after normalcy is restored, another DTC official said A bus was torched allegedly by Gurmeet Ram Rahim's followers in northeast Delhi's Loni Chowk.

A fire also engulfed two coaches of the Rewa Express stationed at the Anand Vihar Railway Station here. Railway officials said it was not immediately clear if it was a case of arson and that investigations were underway.

A special CBI court in Panchkula in Haryana convicted the 50-year-old self-styled godman in the 2002 rape case, triggering widespread violence and arson by his supporters in Punjab and Haryana.

At least 30 people were killed and more than 250 injured in the violence that left a trail of destruction and vandalism.

Massive arson and violence broke out in the Panchkula after the guilty verdict for Ram Rahim.
New Delhi:
As violence by the followers of Gurmeet Ram Rahim spiraled out of control yesterday evening, reaching Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and the borders of Delhi, the Punjab and Haryana High Court ordered strict penalty for Dera Sacha Sauda. The entire property of the organisation -- led by its self-styled spiritual leader Ram Rahim -- should be attached for the damage they caused to public property, the court said.

A hearing will be held at 10 am today by the full bench of the High Court, which has ordered the police to file cases in this regard. A report will also be submitted on the violence.

Dera Sacha Sauda describes itself as a social welfare and spiritual organisation and says it has 50 million followers and has a matrix of popular centres across Punjab and Haryana. Its sprawling 100-acre campus in Sirsa, Haryana, has its own schools, sports village, hospital, confectionery, a spice factory, agricultural farm and a cinema hall. Cleanliness drives organised by the sect have featured political VVIPS, including Chief Minister  ML Khattar.

Yesterday afternoon, Ram Rahim, 50, was found guilty of raping two women followers in 2002, by a court in Panchkula. Within minutes, massive arson and violence broke out in the city -- located 11 km from Chandigarh -- where more than a lakh of his followers had been camping out for the last four days. Thirty people have been killed and 250 injured in the violence that followed the conviction of Ram Rahim. The police, which tried to control the crowd using teargas and lathis, were heavily outnumbered. By 5 pm, the army had to be called in to control the situation.

The violence spread fast to parts of Punjab and soon reached the borders of Delhi. Several coaches of a train were torched in Anand Vihar on the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, and a bus was set afire in Loni, another border area.

In Panchkula, at least one car and a fire engine were torched. The media was attacked, an NDTV live broadcast van was set on fire and totally destroyed. An NDTV engineer was held down by a mob and hit on the head.
 Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh has been found guilty of raping two women
Yesterday, as more and more followers of Ram Rahim poured into Panchkula, the court ripped apart the Haryana government for failing to control the situation. The judges said the government was already guilty of dereliction of duty by allowing Panchkula to turn into an outpost of Ram Rahim's sect.

Yesterday morning, the court said the ""forces should not hesitate to use weapons, if required"", while hearing a PIL on the situation in Panchkula. The court said any incident of arson must be filmed to identify the culprits. They also asked for video footage to review if the property was appropriately protected.

Gurmeet Ram Rahim's followers have been provided clean drinking water, meals and even umbrellas.
Panchkula:
The verdict in the rape case against Dera Sacha Sauda Chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh is out and the CBI court has found him guilty of raping two women followers in 2002. He has been taken into custody and will be sentenced on Monday. His followers, at least a lakh in Panchkula, wept, some fainted, as they waited for the verdict, have been told to clear the area.

After their arrival in the city from different parts of Punjab, Haryana and even Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, they have made parks, roads, areas under flyovers their temporary homes. They have been sleeping near the highway outside the town, spreading tarpaulins on the ground. There are no toilets, so they have been using petrol stations, hidden corners, roadsides and also the banks of a river nearby.

In a video message at midnight, Ram Rahim had appealed to his followers to disperse and return home, and urged them to keep calm. However, his devotees won't budge as they didn't want to miss out on the opportunity of meeting him. The followers left their homes not knowing when they would be back, so packing huge supplies of food, water was out of question. So who is providing for them? Their guru as well as his followers in the city.

The Dera has made all necessary arrangements for the followers - from clean drinking water and meals to tents and umbrellas. At different times during the day, the devotees could be seen sitting in neat lines for the langar served by Dera.

The sect claims to have 50 million followers around the world, and regularly conducts mass camps to donate blood and plant trees as also meditation courses online. It has also funded and constructed hostels for young girls and hospitals and helped with the rehabilitation of sex workers.

After breaks up, women tend to term their consensual physical acts as rape, Delhi High Court
New Delhi:
When a relationship breaks up, women tend to term their consensual physical acts as incidents of rape, the Delhi High Court has observed this while upholding the acquittal of a government official in a rape case.

Justice Pratibha Rani made the observation while rejecting the plea of a 29-year-old woman, who has recently filed a domestic violence case against her husband, seeking his prosecution in the rape case lodged by her before marrying the man in 2015.

The woman had moved the high court challenging the trial court's March 2016 order acquitting him.

""This court had observed on number of occasions that the number of cases where both persons, out of their own will and choice, develop consensual physical relationship, when the relationship breaks up due to some reason, the women use the law as a weapon for vengeance and personal vendetta.

""They tend to convert such consensual acts as an incidents of rape may be out of anger and frustration thereby defeating the very purpose of the provision. This requires a clear demarcation between the rape and consensual sex especially in the case where complaint is that consent had been given on promise of marriage,"" the court observed.

He was let off by the trial court as the woman, who had alleged that she was raped after being made to consume a sedative-laced drink, turned hostile before the lower court.

Initially, after lodging of the rape case, she, along with the man, had moved the high court and subsequently the Supreme Court seeking quashing of the FIR on the ground that they wished to get married.

However, both the courts rejected their plea and asked them to face the trial, during which the woman did not make any incriminating statement against him.

""Since in a case under Sections 376 (rape) and 328 (poisoning) of the IPC, to prove the factum of alleged sexual assault, she is the only star witness and she preferred not to support the case of the prosecution, the trial court was justified in closing the evidence and acquitting the accused,"" the high court noted.

The judge said that under these circumstances, ""the court had hardly any option, but to acquit the accused"".

A Delhi court sentenced two rickshaw pullers to imprisonment till death (Representational)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court today sentenced two rickshaw pullers to imprisonment for the remainder of their life for raping a woman in New Delhi on the pretext of taking her home.

Refusing to show leniency, the court said they committed the heinous crime on a hapless woman who had lost her way.

Additional Sessions Judge Ramesh Kumar held UP resident Ehsaan and Bihar resident Umesh Giri guilty and sentenced them to life imprisonment for remainder of their natural lives.

""Instead of helping her, Ehsaan induced her to accompany him to the place of incident on the pretext of dropping her at her destination where his associate Giri joined him and they both in furtherance of their common intention committed gang rape on her,"" the court said.

The court, which imposed a fine of Rs 25,000 each on the two convicts, said the amount shall be paid to the victim.

It also took into consideration the brutality inflicted by the two men on the victim.

An FIR was registered in September last year on the allegation that the woman was raped by two rickshaw pullers at a bus stand near Mata Sundri College in Central Delhi.

The woman was living separately from her husband and two children. Following a quarrel with her brother, with whom she was residing in UP, the woman somehow managed to reach New Delhi railway station in the night.

At the station, the accused Ehsaan assured her he would drop her to her destination but took her to a deserted place where co-accused Giri joined him in raping the woman.

Another rickshaw puller, who witnessed the crime, caught hold of one of the accused and informed the police.

During the trial, the duo claimed they were falsely implicated by the eye witness as he wanted to extort money.

The court, while holding them guilty, relied on the depositions of the woman and the eye witness saying they were in full consonance with medical and scientific evidence brought on record by the prosecution.

Public prosecutor A T Ansari sought maximum punishment for the convicts saying the offence committed by them was not only diabolical, gruesome and brutal but also alarming.

He contended that the convicts took advantage of the woman's vulnerable condition and said a strong message needs to be conveyed to the society to prevent repetition of such offence.

The court also praised the prosecution for bringing overwhelming corroborative evidence in the form of deposition of eye witness, medical evidence in the form of injury sustained by the woman, and scientific evidence which established the guilt of the accused persons.

The court said the police had given a ""deaf ear"" to a previous order (Representational)
New Delhi:
A senior Delhi Police officer has been directed by a city court to sensitise its officials to prudently deal with cases of sexual assault and adhere to the mandates of higher courts.

Metropolitan Magistrate Abhilash Malhotra passed the direction while pulling up the police for not complying with its order to assess the threat perception and provide security to an alleged rape victim, who is now missing.

""It is very strange that in a case where the court has ordered to assess threat perception and provide security to the complainant/rape victim, she is now missing,"" the court said, adding the officials had given a ""deaf ear"" to its order.

The court also directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) concerned to look into the issue and file a status report before it on July 31.

""The DCP is also directed to sensitise the officers to deal with cases of sexual assault with prudence and keeping in view the mandates given by the higher courts,"" it said.

The court was hearing a complaint filed by a woman alleging that she was raped, illegally confined and threatened by the accused persons. The court had then called for a status report from the police.

During the first hearing in the court, the woman sought to withdraw her complaint without giving any reason, which prompted the court to direct the police to assess the threat perception and provide necessary security to her.

On March 23, the additional DCP of north district filed a report stating that the woman could not be contacted as she was not found residing at her given address and her mobile phone was also switched off.

The court, however, noted that on the same day, another sub-inspector filed a separate report before it stating that the woman gave a written statement to him claiming that she had given the complaint under some pressure and her signatures were taken on a blank paper to falsely implicate the accused.

When she came to know that she was being misused, she moved an application in the court to stop legal proceedings.

The court noted that the reports filed by the two police officials were ""absolutely contradictory"".

""In his report, the additional DCP is informing the court that the complainant is not traceable, whereas to the contrary the sub inspector recorded the hand-written statement of the complainant and placed it before the court.

""It is not understood that when the complainant was traceable, why threat assessment was not done as directed by the court on March 22,"" the magistrate said in its order.

The court said it was clear that the conduct on the part of the two officials has remained ""negligent"".

A Class 10 student delivered a premature baby inside the washroom of a government school.
New Delhi:
A 15-year-old girl delivered a premature baby inside the washroom of a government school in North Delhi; her neighbour who had allegedly raped her repeatedly over a period of one year has been arrested, police said.

The class 10 student had gone to the school in Mukherjee Nagar on Thursday to give an exam. She reportedly experienced stomach ache and went to the washroom, where she gave birth to the baby.

The girl was rushed to a hospital by the school authorities and the police was informed.

She reportedly told the police that she was raped four-five times by her 51-year-old neighbour during the past one year. The accused used to give money to the girl asking her not to inform about his activities to anyone, police said.

The accused was later identified by the girl and arrested yesterday. He hails from Bihar and works as a autorickshaw driver in Delhi, they said.

The man told the police that he gave the girl some abortion pills after she told him about her stomach pains but did not realise that they failed to work, a police official said.

The pills created complications due to which the girl delivered the premature baby in its 26th week only, the official said.

Even the girl's parents did not realise that their daughter was pregnant and ignored it thinking that her stomach problem was merely a gastric ailment.

https://www.gadgets360.com/apps/news/uber-delhi-rape-law-firm-probe-1715915,N/A,N/A,"rape, sexual harassment",New Delhi,Incident timeframe: Week before article publication,"Uber Technologies has hired a law firm to investigate how it obtained the medical records of a Delhi woman executive who was raped by an Uber driver in 2014. The review will focus in part on accusations from some current and former employees that bribes were involved, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The law firm O'Melveny & Myers LLP, which is in the early stages of the probe, was hired by the ride service after employees gave contradictory accounts of how Uber obtained the medical records, one of the people said.
The firm is also exploring whether former Chief Executive Travis Kalanick knew how Uber came into possession of the records, the person added.
Kalanick through a spokesman declined to comment. Uber also declined to comment, and O'Melveny & Myers did not respond to a request for comment. Members of Uber's board were briefed about the investigation in recent days, shortly before five major Uber investors sent a letter to Kalanick to demand his resignation, said the person. The probe was likely one reason the board turned against Kalanick, who stepped down on Tuesday, the first person said.
ALSO SEEUber's Months of Crises: What You Should Know
The investigation is ongoing and has not reached any conclusions on whether Uber improperly obtained the records. Reuters has no evidence that bribery occurred.
The rape survivor from Delhi sued Uber last week, accusing the ride service operator of improperly obtaining and sharing her medical records. The suit said that shortly after the rape occurred, former Uber Asia chief Eric Alexander ""met with Delhi police and intentionally obtained plaintiff's confidential medical records.""
Alexander, through spokeswoman Heather Wilson, denied paying any bribes and said that the files containing the victim's records had been obtained through appropriate, legal methods.
A Delhi police spokesman did not answer multiple phone calls from Reuters to seek comment. The rapist was convicted in 2015.
According to a person familiar with conversations between Kalanick and Alexander, the two executives had discussed obtaining the victim's records because they suspected the rape might have been fabricated by Uber rival Ola to damage the company.
Another person said Alexander showed the medical files to colleagues in New Delhi more than once.
Wilson denied that Alexander had discussed or shared the records with colleagues. She said that Alexander believed the victim was raped and never expressed the view that it was a set up. Uber fired Alexander earlier this month.
Kalanick, 40, announced late on Tuesday that he was resigning as chief executive, though he would remain on the board of Uber. He said he had accepted ""the investors' request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight.""
Privately held Uber has grown from startup to a global ride service valued at $68 billion in less than a decade, driven by Kalanick, who set the tone of a company that challenged laws and norms to succeed.
Confidence in Kalanick had been strained this year by claims of sexual harassment in the company and a lawsuit accusing Uber of benefiting from trade secrets stolen from self-driving cartechnology from Alphabet Inc's Waymo.

The trial court in Delhi had also slapped a fine of Rs 60,000 on the rape convict.
New Delhi:
Taking a lenient view towards a 40-year-old man undergoing 10-year-jail term in a rape case, the Delhi High Court has set him free by reducing his sentence to seven years already spent by him behind bars.

The court ordered his immediate release considering that the conduct of the convict, who has a wife and two children to look after, has been satisfactory in prison.

While modifying the sentence, it also noted that despite being granted bail in the case, the convict, a security guard, could not come out of jail as he failed to furnish the bail bond due to poverty.

""Upon hearing and on perusal of trial court judgement and evidence on record, I find that the conviction of appellant (convict) is well merited. However, order on sentence needs to be varied.

""Considering the fact that appellant is in jail for last more than seven years...indicates that his conduct in jail has been satisfactory and he is not involved in any other case and also that he is a poor person, who has family responsibilities to shoulder,"" Justice Sunil Gaur said.

The man had moved the high court challenging a trial court's October 2013 decision sentencing him to ten years in jail for raping and outraging modesty of a married woman, who was his neighbour.

The trial court had also slapped a fine of Rs 60,000 on the convict.

According to the police, the man had sexually assaulted the woman on March 2, 2011 while she was alone in her house. The man, however, had claimed innocence and submitted that he was falsely implicated in the case as he had a quarrel with the woman and her husband over a petty issue.

The lawsuit filed Thursday in a California federal court seeks unspecified damages on behalf of the woman, who is identified only as Jane Doe.
The allegations compound a long string of image problems for the ride-hailing company, whose CEO took a leave of absence earlier this week after an investigation found a dysfunctional culture that allowed sexual harassment. Twenty employees have been fired, and this week a board member was forced to step down after making a sexist remark at an employee meeting.
The new lawsuit says Uber executives falsely portrayed the woman as a liar who made up the 2014 rape in collusion with a competing service seeking to undermine Uber's business. But the driver was convicted of rape and sentenced to life in prison. The first lawsuit was settled in 2015, before the allegations regarding the woman's medical records surfaced last week.
San Francisco-based Uber issued a statement Thursday that didn't deny the allegations. ""No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we're truly sorry that she's had to relive it over the last few weeks,"" the company said.
The new lawsuit alleges that shortly after the rape, Eric Alexander, then Uber's vice president for business in Asia, got the woman's medical records after a meeting with police in New Delhi. Alexander showed them to Emil Michael, then vice president of business, and CEO Travis Kalanick ""so that he (Alexander) could attempt to defame and undermine her very serious allegations of sexual assault and rape,"" the lawsuit says.
Alexander was dismissed from Uber this month after media reports about the medical records, the lawsuit said. Michael left Uber on Monday. Kalanick, who has said he must grow up and needs management help, has taken an indefinite leave. His mother was killed and father was hurt in a May boating accident.
ALSO SEEUber Reportedly Fires Executive Who Obtained Indian Rape Victim's Medical Records
The lawsuit alleges that Kalanick stated publicly after the rape that Uber would support the woman and her family, then put out false conspiracy theories about the woman.
""Rape denial is just another form of the toxic gender discrimination that is endemic at Uber and ingrained in its culture,"" said Douglas Wigdor, a New York attorney who represents the woman.
At the time of the rape, the woman lived in New Delhi, but now she lives in Texas, according to the lawsuit."

The woman who was raped accused Uber CEO Travis Kalanick of buying into the ""narrative of rape denialism""
A peculiar theory at Uber Technologies Inc. that an Indian competitor may have framed the company for a headline-grabbing rape in India in 2014 already has contributed to the ouster of at least two executives at the ride-hailing giant.

Now the victim of that sexual assault is suing, saying Uber executives have failed to apologize to her for their ""outrageous conduct"" in violating her medical privacy.

The lawsuit comes on the heels of Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick's announcement that he will take a leave of absence and the forced departure of his close confidant and the company's head of business, Emil Michael, stemming from an investigation into workplace harassment and culture by former U.S. Attorney Eric Holder.

The woman who was raped by her Uber driver in New Delhi alleged in her suit that Kalanick, Michael and a third executive, Eric Alexander, who also left the company this month, bought into the ""narrative of rape denialism"" by questioning whether she was really raped at all and instead contriving a ""fictitious story"" about rival ride-sharing company Ola Cabs being involved in her account of events.

""No one should have to go through a horrific experience like this, and we're truly sorry that she's had to relive it over the last few weeks,"" Uber said Thursday in a statement.

Michael and Alexander are named as defendants in the case, along with Kalanick. Alexander declined to comment through a spokeswoman and a representative of Michael didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Holder's Investigation

The mishandling of the rape case figured into Holder's investigation, which was prompted by a former employee's allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination at Uber. A separate examination by a law firm of 215 human resources claims at Uber has resulted in more than 20 people being fired.

The woman, who is described as a resident of Texas but is identified only as Jane Doe in Thursday's complaint, previously blamed Uber for her assault in a lawsuit that settled in 2015 for at least $3 million, according to two people familiar with the matter. Her new complaint was filed by the same New York law firm, Wigdor LLP, that previously represented her.

Doe claims that Michael, who was the company's senior vice president for business, and Alexander, then vice president for business, traveled to the Indian capital city following the attack where they allegedly acquired her medical records without her consent.

They're accused of discussing those records with other staff at Uber while speculating about her motives for reporting the rape. Alexander retained the records until being forced to return them in late 2015, yet the company may still possess the documents, according to the complaint.

'Always Be Hustling'

""Uber has taken startup culture, in which fierceness and 'always be hustling' are prioritized above people, to a new extreme, perpetuating rape culture and violating all bounds of decency as to customer privacy,"" according to the complaint in federal court in San Francisco, where Uber is based. ""By focusing on whether she was really raped at all and painting the plaintiff as an opportunist and a liar, defendants"" are promoting the notion that women only report sexual assault for personal gain.

After the India driver's conviction in 2015, the head of Uber's India business, Amit Jain, said in a statement: ""Sexual assault is a terrible crime, and we're pleased he has now been brought to justice.""

Doe, who alleges intrusion into private affairs, public disclosure of private facts and defamation, is seeking a court order forbidding future misconduct by the company as well as monetary damages.

The case is Doe v. Uber, 3:17-cv-03470, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco)

However, the girl had initially alleged that she was gang-raped but after investigation it emerged that she was lying, police said.

The girl went to the park in the area around 9.30 pm on uesday where her 22-year-old friend allegedly forced himself on her, police said.

When the girl returned home, her parents asked her why she got late and in order to save her friend and not get scolded by her parents, she cooked up a story that she was gang-raped, a senior police officer said.

""She alleged that four men raped her in front of her male friend,"" said the officer.

He said it was only after the CCTV footage of the area was analysed and her friend questioned, that the truth emerged.

The accused friend has been arrested, the officer said. The girl was known to the accused for around a year as he worked near her house, he added.

A man was thrashed by a mob for allegedly trying to rape a girl in New Delhi. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A 25-year-old man, who was thrashed by a mob for allegedly attempting to rape a 4-year-old girl in east Delhi's Pandav Nagar, died from his injuries at a hospital this morning.

Police said the man - identified as Golu - lured the girl, who had gone to have snacks at a roadside eatery, to a deserted spot near Sanjay Lake on Thursday night.

When the girl did not return home, her mother started looking for her. A local told her that he had seen Golu taking her towards the lake.

When the woman along with some locals reached the spot, they allegedly found the accused forcing himself on the girl.

A mob attacked the accused with stones and sticks. They kept hitting him until he fell unconscious, said a police officer.

After the police learnt about the incident, he was rushed to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital and later referred to GTB hospital, where he died during treatment. His body has been handed over to his family.

Police have not been able to identify those who beat up the man.

His family has alleged that he was killed by a group of persons for resisting a robbery. The police, however, have refuted the allegation.

Golu, who hailed from Basti in Uttar Pradesh, lived in Shashi Garden area near Pandav Nagar. He was addicted to alcohol and drugs, the police said.

A Delhi resident has been booked for allegedly raping a woman and her minor daughter, Police said.
Gurgaon:
A Delhi resident has been booked for allegedly raping a 35-year-old woman and her 15-year-old daughter, Gurgaon Police said today. The woman told police she met the accused, a resident of Amar Colony in Delhi, at a Gurgaon market a few months ago.

Hours after a case was registered in the matter, the accused, Ashish, was arrested from his residence at Amar Colony in Gokulpur of Delhi, ACP and PRO of the Gurgaon police, Manish Sehgal said.

She met the accused, Ashish, 25 days ago in Rajendra Park market in Gurgaon and shared her address with him when he asked, Mr Sehgal said.

The woman, who is a widow, told police that she lives in Vishnu Garden with her 15-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son.

""The next day, Ashish reached her residence when her children were playing outside and raped her,"" the victim said in her complaint.

She told the police that she did not disclose the incident to anyone as she was afraid.

The woman also told that over the next few days, the accused raped her several times and filmed the act.

The accused used to threaten her that he would upload the video on the Internet, the woman said.

Ashish later raped her 15-year-old daughter and filmed the crime similarly, Mr Sehgal said.

On the basis of a complaint by the woman, a case was today registered against him on the charge of rape and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

The case comes close to the heels of the gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman and killing of her infant daughter in Gurgaon.

https://www.gadgets360.com/apps/features/uber-woes-mount-ahead-of-workplace-probe-report-1709937,N/A,N/A,"rape, sexual harassment",Delhi (specific area not mentioned),Timeframe unknown (article published on N/A),"Uber has parted ways with another top executive, in the latest dent to the reputation of the ridesharing giant as it prepares to release the results of a probe into workplace misconduct.
The executive, Eric Alexander, read and discussed medical information about a woman raped in India in 2014 during an Uber ride, according to reports in the New York Times and Recode.
Alexander, who headed Uber's Asia-Pacific operations, showed the records to Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick and others, the reports said.
An Uber spokeswoman told AFP on Thursday that Alexander is ""no longer with the company,"" but declined to comment on the reasons for his departure or on the reports on his handling of the India rape case.
In the case, a 26-year-old woman was assaulted after hailing an Uber ride.
An Indian court in 2015 sentenced the Uber driver to life in prison in a case that inflamed fears over sexual violence in the capital.
The reports about Alexander come amid a far-reaching investigation into misconduct and workplace practices at Uber, which operates in dozens of countries and is valued at some $68 billion (roughly Rs. 4,37,030 crores).
Earlier this week, Uber said it had fired 20 people following preliminary results of the investigation.
The on-demand ride service said the terminations came as it looked into a total of 215 claims of discrimination, harassment, unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation and ""physical security.""
A report containing recommendations for changes inside Uber to cure workplace ills was to be released next week.
Uber has seen a shake-up in its executive ranks as it works through a series of scandals that included disclosures about a culture of sexism, cut-throat workplace tactics, and covert use of law enforcement-evading software.
Jackdaw Research analyst Jan Dawson referred to the incident involving the Uber executive in India as a ""notable and damaging"" revelation, calling it ""absurd"" that an internal probe depicted by the company as far-reaching seemed to have spared the executive.
""Overall, plenty more evidence here of both the nasty culture and the difficulty of turning it around,"" Dawson said in a blog post.
Stolen secrets?
In addition to the workplace investigation, Uber faces a potentially damaging lawsuit over trade secrets allegedly stolen from Alphabet's self-driving car unit Waymo.
Uber fired executive Anthony Levandowski, who came from the unit previously known as Google car, for failing to meet a deadline to turn over information for an internal investigation.
Waymo's lawsuit contends that Levandowski in December 2015 downloaded files from a highly confidential design server to a laptop and took the data with him to the startup.
Uber has lost other key executives this year and one report said it is the subject of a criminal investigation.
Top engineering executive Amit Singhal resigned in February after the ride-sharing titan learned he ended his career at Google after a sexual harassment complaint, reports said.
In March, Uber's president, Jeff Jones, resigned after just six months.
The woes so far have not hit Uber's growth trajectory, but some analysts say Uber's problems won't fixed without a change in leadership.
""Firing 20 people is just a Band-Aid to act as if they are doing something,"" analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said of Uber.
""Nothing will change"" as long as Kalanick, ""who seems to be the source of many problems"" remains on top, the analyst argued.
Kalanick, who was also embarrassed this year for a video where he berates an Uber driver, has said Uber is seeking a number two executive as part of an effort to restore confidence.
Uber's biggest problem may be that it is ""bleeding out cash,"" according Enderle.
Uber said that its revenue during the first three months of this year rose some 18 percent to $3.4 billion (roughly Rs. 21,849 crores), but the company logged a loss of $708 million (roughly Rs. 4,549 crores) without taking into account stock compensation for employees.
Uber cited the numbers as progress, given that losses in the preceding quarter totaled $991 million (roughly Rs. 6,369 crores)."

Two bus drivers and a conductor were arrested for allegedly gang-raping the 14-year-old girl.
Chennai:
A 14-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped in a private bus by two drivers and a conductor in Tamil Nadu's Salem district, about 350 kilometres from state capital Chennai, on Monday. The three accused in the case, a stark reminder of the 2012 Nirbahaya gang-rape case in Delhi, have been arrested.

Police says the girl, who had finished Class IX this year, ran away from home in Salem and boarded the bus on Monday afternoon. She stayed on the bus for the next seven hours as it made several trips from Salem to Omalur about 20 kilometres away and back.

After the last trip, the crew parked the bus in an isolated area about seven kilometres away from Omalur and allegedly sexually assaulted the teenager one after the other, police said.  

An officer told NDTV, ""The girl says the men threatened her to not get off the bus. She escaped and screamed when the third man assaulted her sexually. Local people rescued her and handed over the men.""

The parents of the girl are daily wage labourers in Salem. Police say the girl, a Dalit, had run away from home twice earlier as well.

Sources say the girl is being counselled and looked after at a children's home. It's not clear whether she underwent any medical examination so far. Senior officers couldn't be reached for more information.

A case has been registered under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and Prevention of SC/ST Atrocities Act besides invoking provisions of kidnap, rape, intimidation and attempt to rape.

New Delhi:
A 6-year-old child, allegedly raped by her stepfather at his workplace in south Delhi's Saket area, is reportedly in critical condition. The incident comes days after Haryana's Rohtak case where a 10-year-old girl was found in advanced stage of pregnancy after being repeatedly raped by her stepfather.

The girl suffered from extensive internal injuries and has been admitted to All India Institute Of Medical Science or AIIMS in Delhi, said the Delhi Commission for Women or DCW in a statement.

The police has registered a case and arrested the stepfather.

""The girl's condition is very serious. Her private parts are infected with pus and according to the doctors, she will have to undergo a surgery. Taking note of the seriousness of the crime, the judge appointed for this case reached AIIMS to record the minor's statement,"" said the DCW statement.

The incident came to light after a woman in the child's neighborhood saw her bleeding and informed the DCW on its 181 women helpline.

The accused had married the girl's mother a year ago.

In her statement, the girl said that the accused took her to his workplace and sexually assaulted her. She alleged that he beat her up and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident, reported the Press Trust of India.

""When the DCW team reached the minor's house, they saw that the girl was in pain and bleeding. Meanwhile, the police also reached her house and took the girl and her parents to a police station along with the woman who had informed the DCW about the incident,"" the DCW statement said.

DCW members visited the child at AIIMS and counselled her.

""The father said he committed the gruesome act under the influence of alcohol. He is a caretaker of a house in Saket. He had sexually assaulted her couple of days ago too,"" it further added.

DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal demanded that the accused person be hanged immediately.

Santosh Kumar Singh was convicted and sentenced to life for rape, murder of Priyadarshini Mattoo in 1996
New Delhi:
Santosh Kumar Singh, who was convicted and sentenced to life for the rape and murder of a law student in 1996, was today granted 15 days parole by the Delhi High Court to write Master of Laws (LLM) exams.

While granting the relief, Justice Ashutosh Kumar allowed Mr Singh to visit his hometown in Bihar for two days to attend his brother-in-law's marriage on June 2.

The court said that parole would be granted subject to the convict furnishing a bond of Rs 25,000 and a surety of the like amount.

The court granted the relief to Mr Singh after taking into consideration that he had spent 14 and a half years in jail, displayed satisfactory behaviour and not misused the privilege of parole when it was granted to him for writing exams.

Mr Singh, a third-year law student in Delhi University, had raped and murdered 25-year old Mattoo in January 1996.

He was acquitted by the trial court on December 3, 1999, but the Delhi High Court had on October 27, 2006 reversed the decision, holding him guilty of rape and murder.

The high court had also awarded death penalty to him in the case. Mr Singh, son of a former senior IPS officer, had challenged his conviction and death sentence awarded by the high court.

In October 2010, the Supreme Court had upheld Mr Singh's conviction, but reduced the death sentence to life imprisonment.

The team, comprising 41 officers, was yesterday felicitated by Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik.
New Delhi:
The Delhi Police team that had probed the horrific Nirbhaya gangrape case will be training their counterparts about the fundamentals of framing chargesheets in complex rape cases.

The Supreme Court had recently upheld the death penalty to four convicts in the December 16, 2012 gangrape case of a 23-year-old paramedic student inside a moving bus in South Delhi.

She had succumbed to her injuries on December 29, 2012 at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

The Supreme court had appreciated the role of the Delhi Police for collecting unimpeachable scientific evidence to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt in the court.

The team, comprising 41 officers, was today felicitated by Delhi Police commissioner Amulya Patnaik. ""Not only did the officers crack it in a record time, they followed it up with collection of scientific evidence, systematic and painstaking work that led to a conviction in the case,"" Mr Patnaik said.

The officers, who were part of the probe, said that they are ""professionally satisfied"".

The then additional deputy commissioner of police (south) P S Kushwah said they were ""racing against time"".

He said some women officers were designated to counsel the victims' family and assure them that justice would be done.

At every stage of the court proceedings, there were special investigation teams who briefed the counsels appearing on behalf of the victim.

Rajender Singh, who was then an inspector and a key investigator in the case, said they will be imparting training to their fellow officers in drafting chargesheets.

Another officer said they have held training sessions with some police personnel but this is likely to be made into a regular exercise.

The officers recalled the trying times during those days of investigation.

""We delivered against all odds,"" said Mr Singh.

""From facing media and public outrage to handling law and order situation and the various commissions, we were facing so many things but we didn't let our focus shift,"" he said.

""The front gate of the Vasant Vihar police station was blocked by media and public. We used the back gate, which meant climbing a wall, to enter our office,"" recalled Mr Singh.

He said they they sat for 72 hours at a stretch inside the police station with the then DCP (South) Chhaya Sharma and Kushwah. They even had all their meals there.

The officers were also shocked by the brutality that had been meted out to the victim.

""We were shocked and angered at what had happened. But we maintained our objectivity and channelised our anger into the probe,"" said Mr Singh.

Brutality was used as an evidence in the case with doctors deposing as prosecution witnesses and listing out the reasons for her death, said the officer.

Mr Singh also said the bus was traced from a total of 381 white buses on the basis of a CCTV footage procured from the spot in Mahipalpur where the accused had dumped the victims.

The wheel cap of the front tyre of the bus was missing and the vehicle had 'Yadav' written on it, he said.

These clues led them to the bus owner in Noida and subsequently to the bus that was seized from R K Puram area.

The case saw many firsts, said another officer. From matching the DNA found on the victim's body to those of the accused and using odontology, a branch of forensic science on bite mark analysis, the police relied on scientific evidence to prove the charges, said another officer.

The team probing the case and the victim's family forged a lifelong bond, said the then SHO of Vasant Vihar police station, Anil Kumar Sharma.

""Her family was there when I lost my loved ones. Yesterday, her mother visited us and spent a couple of hours with my family. We forged a strong bond,"" he added.

Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence for four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape case.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court has bowed to public pressure in confirming the death sentences awarded to the convicts of December 16, 2012 sensational gangrape and murder case, their counsel said on Friday.

A petition seeking review of the judgment would be filed, as the top court has succumbed to public pressure and the demonstrations which were carried out in protest against the incident, advocate A P Singh, who was the defense counsel for two of the four convicts, said.

Advocate M L Sharma also said a review petition would be filed as he claimed that one of his clients, Mukesh Singh, who will face the gallows, was implicated in the case.

Moments after the judgement was pronounced, Singh, who appeared for convicts Akshay Thakur and Vinay Sharma, said he was waiting for the copy of the judgement and would decide the further course of action after reading the entire judgement but a review petition would surely be filed.

""Terrorists are getting relief from the judiciary. But we have full faith in the Supreme Court. All the four hail from poor background and I hope they will get justice. We will file the review petition after reading the judgment,"" the counsel said.

Sharma, who also appeared for Mukesh Singh and Pawan Gupta, said without questioning the gruesome incident which claimed the life of the 23-year-old paramedic, it is a case where one of the accused has been implicated in it.

Justice Dipak Misra today confirmed death sentence for 4 convicts in 2012 Delhi gang-rape case.
New Delhi:
Justice Dipak Misra, who led the Supreme Court bench that confirmed death to four convicts in the Nirbhaya gang-rape case, is set to be the next Chief Justice of India in August.

For the 63-year-old judge, this was the second big rape and murder case in three days.

On Wednesday, he dismissed an appeal by Vasant Dupare, who was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of a four-year-old in 2008. Dupare gave the little girl chocolates and took her to a deserted spot, raped her, crushed her head with stones and hid the body.

Dismissing Dupare's petition asking the Supreme Court to review its own decision, the judges noted ""the extreme depravity and barbaric manner in which the crime was committed clearly outweigh the mitigating circumstances"".

Today too, Justice Misra, along with Justice R Bhanumathi and Justice Ashok Bhushan, used sharp words for the men who gang-raped a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in December 2012, tortured her with an iron rod and pulled out her intestines before dumping her on a road.
 Nirbhaya gang-rape case: The incident led to widespread protests and outrage in the country.
""The nature and manner of the crime devastated social trust and is in the rarest of rare category warranting the death penalty,"" said the judges.

""The brutal and demonic manner in which the gang-rape was committed, the victim and her friend were thrown out of the bus and the attempt to kill them to stave evidence cannot be accepted or tolerated,"" they ruled.

""Aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances in the case,"" they said.

In July 2015, Justice Misra was among the three judges who were up all night in a historic hearing to decide on terrorist Yakub Memon's last-minute appeal against his hanging for the 1993 Mumbai blasts in which 257 people were killed.

At 5 am on July 30, it was Justice Misra who announced the court's decision: ""Stay of death warrant would be a travesty of justice. The plea is dismissed."" Memon was hanged two hours later.

Nirbhaya gang-rape: Police officer Chaya Sharma was investigating the case with team of 100 people.
New Delhi:
""Those who did this to me, do not spare them"" - These were the words that police officer Chaya Sharma heard from Nirbhaya, the young student gang-raped on a moving bus and tortured with an iron rod in December 2012.

On Friday, as the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence for four of the rapists, the officer mentally thanked Nirbhaya for her consistent statements. ""Evidence produced by the Delhi police is impeccable,"" said the three judges.

""If we got a conviction, it was due to Nirbhaya herself. Her consistent statements made it possible,"" said Ms Sharma, who is now with the National Human Rights Commission.

She remembered when she first met the 23-year-old in hospital - fighting for her life after being brutalized in what judges today described as a ""demonic"" attack - her attitude was striking.

""She never clammed up like rape victims usually do. Her attitude was very positive,"" recalled the officer.

Nirbhaya initially gave her statement to doctors at the Safdarjung hospital and two magistrates. In all three statements, she remembered and shared details that ultimately helped the police.

These statements were treated as dying declarations after her death in a Singapore hospital 13 days after the attack.

The biggest challenge before the police was that the rapists were unknown to the woman. ""So our task was very hard. We had to start the case from zero,"" Ms Sharma shared.
 Nirbhaya gang-rape case: The Supreme Court upheld the death sentence of the four adult convicts.
The initial clues that the team got were that the bus had red seats and yellow curtains.

""Searching for the bus was very difficult. We short-listed about 300 buses and our team meticulously worked around the leads we were getting.""

Ms Sharma was assisted by a team of 100 men and women. ""I had a very good team. They were very thorough in their jobs. We concluded that the arrogance with which the accused had committed crime showed that they were familiar to the area,"" she said as she explained how the police zeroed in on the six men.

The police scrutinised CCTV footage but were not getting much from it. But then they saw Yadav written on a white bus, which narrowed down their search.

""The driver or the cleaner had to be from the surrounding area. We worked around that and one by one, we caught all of them,"" Ms Sharma said.

Within 18 hours of the attack, the police made the first arrest - bus driver Ram Singh. ""After his interrogation we arrested others.""

As the Supreme Court confirmed that the convicts would hang, the police team involved in the investigations felt vindicated. Ms Sharma allowed herself a moment of pride as she commented, ""We filed a charge-sheet in just 18 days. This chargesheet stood judicial scrutiny of two lower courts and now the Supreme Court. If it was faulty, we would have been hanged instead.""

The Supreme Court upheld the death sentence of the the Nirbhaya gangrape case convicts. (File)
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentence for four convicts in the gang rape and brutal murder of a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus in Delhi on December 16, 2012. The four men - Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh - had appealed in the top court after the High Court ruled that they should be hanged. The parents of the young woman, who came to be called ""Nirbhaya"" or fearless, were present in court today when the three-judge bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra pronounced verdict.
What the judges have said in the 429-page judgment:
""The present case clearly comes within the category of 'rarest of rare case' where the question of any other punishment is 'unquestionably foreclosed'. If at all there is a case warranting award of death sentence, it is the present case.""
""The dying declarations... do withstand close scrutiny and they are consistent with each other.""
""It is absolutely obvious that the accused persons had found an object for enjoyment in her and, as is evident, they were obsessed with the singular purpose sans any feeling to ravish her as they liked, treat her as they felt.""
""It sounds like a story from a different world where humanity has been treated with irreverence.""
""We are compelled to arrive at the singular conclusion that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances now brought on record.""
""The wanton lust, vicious appetite...have driven the appellant to commit a crime which can bring in a 'tsunami' of shock in the mind of the collective, send a chill down the spine of the society.""
""After throwing the informant and the deceased victim, the convicts tried to run the bus over them so that there would be no evidence against them. They made all possible efforts in destroying the evidence..."" 
""The cruel manner in which the gang-rape was committed in the moving bus... and the coldness with which both the victims were thrown naked in cold wintery night of December, shocks the collective conscience of the society.""
""The gruesome offences were committed with highest viciousness. Human lust was allowed to take such a demonic form.""
""The evidence brought on record with regard to finger prints is absolutely impeccable""

The woman was picked up from her residence in Uttar Pradesh's Indirapuram.
New Delhi:
The Delhi Police has taken a woman, accused of honey-trapping BJP lawmaker KC Patel, into custody for questioning over the incident today. The woman, who had accused Mr Patel of rape, was picked up from her residence in Uttar Pradesh's Indirapuram.

""We have taken the woman, who honey-trapped the BJP MP, into custody for questioning,"" a senior police officer was quoted by news agency IANS.  

BJP leader KC Patel, who represents Gujarat's Valsad constituency in the Lok Sabha, alleged that he was drugged and filmed in a compromising state by the woman. He added that the woman later accused him of rape, threatened to upload the videos and photos online and demanded Rs 5 crore from him. 

Mr Patel, 67, told the police that the woman had asked the lawmaker for help and had him accompany her to her house in Ghaziabad.  The woman, however, alleges that she met Mr Patel for the first time on March 3 at the Supreme Court and was raped by him several times. 

On Mr Patel's complaint, a case of blackmail and extortion was registered against the woman, who is a lawyer of the Supreme Court. 

""I have full faith in justice and doodh ka doodh, paani ka paani ho jayega (we will know the truth),"" the BJP lawmaker said, to news agency ANI.

The police, on Monday, said that the woman heads a gang that specializes in honey-trapping high-profile people, especially lawmakers, after approaching them for help. She had, according to the police, filed a rape case against a Congress lawmaker last year in similar circumstances. The case was dropped.

Delhi Police was slammed by the court for revealing the identities of sexually assaulted children.
New Delhi:
A court in Delhi has rebuked the police for revealing the identity of minors subjected to sexual violence and their parents in a series of cases, violating the law on confidentiality. Taking serious note of the names of the survivors and the names and addresses of their parents being mentioned in the charge-sheets, Additional Sessions Judge Gurdeep Singh said ""this is gross violation of the provision. Therefore, it is directed that the name and address of the child victim on the charge sheet be covered with fluid.""

""Similarly, address of her/his parents be also covered. The name and address of child victim shall remain in police file which shall be confidential,"" it said.

The court was dealing with 14 cases of sexual offences from April 1 to April 7, ranging from rape, molestation, unnatural sex and stalking, in which the police filed charge sheets along with names, addresses and other details of the minors, disclosing their complete identities.

The court was dealing with the cases lodged in various police stations of east Delhi, north east Delhi and Shahdara districts.

The court took serious note of the fact that the provisions of Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act have been violated in various cases.

It referred to the provision of POCSO Act which says that the identity of the children shall not be disclosed during course of investigation or trial and said that despite direction, the police has filed the charge-sheet along with names and addresses of the minors.

The court said this was a blatant violation of the provisions of confidentiality and directed the concerned Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) to ensure that in future no charge sheet shall be filed disclosing such names.

It also directed that the address of child's parents should also not be disclosed as it may reveal their identity.

A case has been filed against an unidentified man for the rape in Delhi's Govindpuri. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A girl alleged that she was raped by a man in South Delhi on Monday, police said. A case has been registered against an unidentified man in the incident that happened during the festival of Holi, they said.

Police said that the underage girl said in her complaint that the unidentified person took her away from the Navjeevan Camp Park in Govindpuri area on Monday night.

""The girl was left near her house around 10 pm. She narrated her ordeal to her mother, who complained to the police. A case was registered under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Romil Banniya said.

""A medical examination at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences corroborated the girl's statement,"" Mr Banniya said.

Police are examining closed-circuit television footage from the area.

Based on early investigation, the crime appeared to have been committed in a planned manner since the accused had smeared his face and clothes with colour to hide his identity.

On Saturday, a 26-year-old woman had to jump from a 20-feet-high balcony in east Delhi to escape five men who allegedly raped her for hours, police said. The injured woman, a mother of two, walked on the streets without a shred of clothing, begging for help but no one came to her rescue, she told the police. All accused have been arrested.

A woman was allegedly raped by five men in East Delhi's Pandav Nagar area
New Delhi:
A 26-year-old woman jumped from a 20-feet-high balcony in east Delhi to escape five men who allegedly raped her for hours, police said. The injured woman, a mother of two, walked on the streets without a shred of clothing, begging for help but no one came to her rescue, she told the police. All accused have been arrested.

Four of them - Lakshay Bhalla, Vikas Kumar, Naveen, and Prateek - work in call centres in Noida near Delhi. The fifth, Swarit is an engineer with Tech Mahindra.

The incident occurred on Saturday when the woman, who lives with her two children in south Delhi, was picked up by Vikas, known to her, and taken to a flat in east Delhi's Pandav Nagar area, police said.

""The woman left with him and on the way met two of his friends. The three brought her to the flat where their other friends were already present,"" police said.

The accused, according to the woman's statement, threatened her and forced her to consume alcohol. They then allegedly locked her in the flat and took turns to rape her till the early hours on Sunday.

At around 5.30 am, the woman managed to reach the balcony and jumped off it. She alerted some passersby, one of who reportedly informed the police.

""The woman was admitted to the Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital for medical treatment and examination. She has sustained minor injuries in her legs,"" a senior police officer said.

Police said further investigation is on since the woman has been changing her statement.

A teen told police that her mother was gang-raped several times by a group including Gayatri Prajapati.
New Delhi:
As Gayatri Prajapati, the Uttar Pradesh minister facing arrest for the gang-rape of a woman, remains missing, her young daughter who is at Delhi's AIIMS hospital, on Thursday recorded her statement with the police. Over two years, her mother was gang-raped several times, allegedly by a group including Mr Prajapati. The daughter claims they had targeted her too. The family has taken refuge in Delhi, saying they were being harassed by the Uttar Pradesh police. A case was registered against Mr Prajapati following the orders of the Supreme Court. In face of a possible arrest, Mr Prajapati -- a Samajwadi Party candidate from high profile Amethi -- has gone missing.

""How can we trust UP police? She was threatening us while taking the statement? We never got any hearing from them even when we went to the DGP,"" said the girl's brother.

Memood Pracha, the lawyer representing the girl's mother objected to the recording of statement. ""Firstly, they did not take permission from the doctors. Also, the police threatened the mother and the daughter and snatched their mobile phone. The girl is still in trauma,"" news agency Press Trust of India quoted him as saying.

The Uttar Pradesh police have denied the allegation. ""I wanted to see their (the family's) Whatsapp records, so I asked for the phone and she refused to give it. It was all done in front of camera,"" said Ameeta Singh, a police officer from Alambag. ""The arrest (of Mr Prajapati) is a possibility,"" she added.

The doctors at AIIMS said the 16-year-old, who was sexually assaulted eight months ago, gets panic attacks, often wakes up at night and had tried to run away from her ward.

""They tried to rape me and held my mother tight as she kept crying and pleaded with them to stop. They threatened her before setting me free,"" the girl said on Wednesday, speaking between long pauses. ""I want to see Prajapati and his men behind the bars,"" PTI quoted her as saying.

Her mother, who alleges she was exploited on the promise of a position in the ruling Samajwadi Party and sand mining contracts, moved Supreme Court after her complaints to the police were allegedly ignored.

The Samajwadi Party has been caught in a catch 22 situation over Mr Prajapati. The party is apprehensive that his arrest may play into the hands of the opposition ahead of the last two phases of the assembly elections in the state. But the lack of an arrest is also being fully exploited by the BJP and the BSP, whose leaders have targeted the ruling party in rally after rally. Mayawati has called it a ""weakness"" of Akhilesh Yadav and BJP's Smriti Irani has called the party a ""protector of rapists"".

UP minister Gayatri Prajapati is among the accused named in the police complaint
New Delhi:
As Gayatri Prajapati, the Uttar Pradesh minister facing arrest for the gang-rape of a woman, remains missing, her young daughter is at the AIIMS hospital in Delhi, heavily sedated and in ""severe trauma"", according to doctors.

The 16-year-old, who was also allegedly targeted, gets panic attacks and often wakes up in the middle of the night. She even tries to run from her ward, the doctors say.

Over two years, her mother was gang-raped several times, allegedly by a group including Mr Prajapati. Eight months ago, the attackers allegedly turned on the teen. Mr Prajapati is among the accused named in a police complaint, which is an embarrassment for the Akhilesh Yadav government in the middle of state polls.

""They tried to rape me and held my mother tight as she kept crying and pleaded with them to stop. They threatened her before setting me free,"" the girl said on Wednesday, speaking between long pauses.

""I want to see Prajapati and his men who attempted to rape me behind the bars. He has ruined our lives permanently. We had to leave our hearth and home to save our lives,"" the Press Trust of India quoted her as saying.

Policemen from Uttar Pradesh have visited the hospital twice to speak to her but were denied permission.

Her mother, who alleges she was exploited on the promise of a position in the ruling Samajwadi Party and sand mining contracts, moved the Supreme Court after her complaints to the police were allegedly ignored. On the court's order, an FIR or complaint was filed against the minister on February 18.

""Constant threat calls from Prajapati's men warning us not to pursue the matter became unbearable and we decided to leave UP to save our lives. My mother then approached the court,"" said the teen.

On Tuesday, a police team searched Mr Prajapati's homes in Lucknow and other cities and said he could not be found.

The 49-year-old minister is a candidate in the Uttar Pradesh election and was last seen campaigning in Amethi, where he is contesting. His request for protection from arrest will be heard by the Supreme Court on Monday.

The girl is haunted by what happened to her and her mother.

""I couldn't take the exams this year....our lives were a mess,"" she said, hoping she can sit for her Class 10 examinations next year.

Doctors at AIIMS say she is ""living in constant fear. She is unable to sleep. We have put her on medication and she is undergoing behavioural therapy.""

Delhi Police has arrested a man in connection with the alleged rape near Hauz Khas Village
New Delhi:
Delhi Police has arrested one person in connection with the alleged rape of a 24-year-old woman in South Delhi's Hauz Khas Village. The accused, a resident of Chandra Vihar, was identified last night, police said today.

Police teams had been working on different leads based on CCTV footage and local intelligence and by questioning parking attendants, private security guards of the Deer Park and other shopkeepers in the locality. The incident happened on the night of February 18 when the woman, who is from northeast India, was returning from a party in Hauz Khas village. She was reportedly with her friends and cousins.

The woman told the police that around 11:30 PM she was offered a drop home by an unknown person.

He apparently told her that his vehicle was parked near Deer Park, which is adjoining Hauz Khas village. The accused, thereafter, on the pretext of guiding the woman, led her to an isolated stretch near the park and allegedly raped her.

Further details are awaited.

Four people were arrested on the charge of sexually assaulting a US tourist. (Representational)
New Delhi:
A local court on Thursday sent four people, including a tourist guide, who were arrested on the charge of sexually assaulting a US tourist in New Delhi earlier this year, to two-day police custody.

Duty Metropolitan Magistrate Sumeet Anand allowed Delhi Police to quiz Aniruddha Singh, Omprakash, Maqsood and Vivek, who were arrested for gang-raping the American tourist.

Police sought custody on the ground that it has to conduct medical examination of the accused and locate the exact crime scene.

They said that custodial interrogation of the accused is also required to identify the fifth accused.

Defence counsel Sandeep Kapur appearing for Vivek, an accused in the case, however, opposed the plea.

The accused were presented before the court after the expiry of their two-day judicial custody.

They were arrested from different cities in the raids conducted by Delhi Police on Monday.

Among the accused, Aniruddha Singh was a Nepal-based tourist guide, Omprakash a driver, Maqsood a helper and Vivek was a bell-boy at the hotel where the crime occurred.

Police initially identified Vivek from the duty register of room service, as he was the first to enter the victim's room on the day of the crime.

Police recorded the 30-year-old victim's statement last week when she arrived in Delhi from America.

As per her complaint, she was gang-raped at a luxury hotel in the first week of April this year.

Delhi Police had registered an FIR earlier this month on the complaint of the woman as External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj intervened in the matter.

The victim had filed a police complaint with the help of an NGO early December, saying that the accused drugged her and sexually assaulted her for two days and also made an MMS.

The accused have, however, denied the charge.

Four men, arrested for allegedly raping a US tourist in a 5-star hotel earlier this year, were today sent to two-day judicial custody by a city court.

Metropolitan Magistrate Harvinder Singh sent the accused to Tihar Jail after Delhi Police moved an application seeking their judicial custody.

Yesterday, the police had arrested a tour guide, a driver, a cleaner and a hotel staff in connection with the alleged gangrape of the woman in April this year.

The US national arrived in New Delhi a few days ago to join the probe and recorded her statement in front of a judicial magistrate where she reiterated that she was gangraped by five persons in a five-star hotel in New York.

Four accused were arrested after the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) issued a notice to Delhi Police asking them why the Rape Crisis Cell of the women's panel was not informed when the victim's statement was recorded.

Earlier, the complainant had said she was not ""satisfied"" with the probe and was ready to come to India to identify the accused.

The woman had alleged that she was raped by the men for two days and also threatened with dire consequences if she reported the matter to anybody.

She had also stated that the accused had made a video of the act and threatened to make it public if she reported the matter to anyone. She had also told the police that the accused had claimed to have sexually assaulted a couple of other female tourists as well.

A team of psychologists and psychiatrists have been assisting the lady in recalling the details of the incident.

The team is also working with the police in their investigation to tie up loose ends.

The US woman, a teacher, was sexually assaulted by five people in April while she was touring country.
New Delhi:
Three days after a 25-year-old US national recorded her statement in front of a city magistrate in a case of gang-rape, Delhi police has arrested four people.

The teacher, a resident of Pennsylvania, had alleged that she was sexually assaulted by five people in April, when she had taken a guided tour to India. Her drinking water, she said, had been spiked with sedatives.

Among those arrested are the tour guide operator, a bus driver and his helper as well as the staff of a five-star hotel located at Connaught Place, where the incident allegedly took place. The police are yet to release the names of the arrested men. The woman is expected to identify them at a test identification parade on Tuesday.

The US woman had returned to India last week to record her statement in court, where she said that for two days, she was continually drugged and sexually assaulted in a hotel room. She had returned to America and lodged a case from there.

The woman had said she had lost her memory of the incident. ""I do not remember writing a good feedback of the tour agency. I regained my memory three months later towards end of July and then decided to file an FIR,"" she had said after returning to India.

But despite writing to the Delhi police through an NGO, in October, the First Information Report in the case was registered only by November-end, she has told the court.  

Speaking to NDTV on Saturday, the 25-year-old had mentioned that she was ""not confident"" by the way Delhi police was handling the matter.

An American teacher said she was drugged, gang-raped by a tour guide and employees of a Delhi hotel.
New Delhi:
An American teacher was on her first ever trip to India during her summer break when she was allegedly gang-raped in a Delhi hotel. Nine months later, she has returned to record her statement and identify her alleged rapists.

The 25-year-old had taken a packaged tour to see India in April. She has alleged that her tour guide laced her water bottle with sedatives and gang-raped her along with employees of the hotel.

""I had come on a guided tour, and I was straightaway taken to the five star hotel in Connaught Place. I was drugged first two days and raped by two employees of the tour company and two of the hotel who I recognise by face,"" she told NDTV.

The women did not go to the police while in India but registered a case through a US-based non-profit after she returned to her home in Pennsylvania. She said the process of filing the case in India from US was very difficult. In her statement today she repeated her charges.

""I have no memories of the incident. I do not remember writing a good feedback of the tour agency. I regained my memory three months later towards end of July and then decided to file an FIR. First reaction of the tour agency and hotel was that they were shocked. But they were not interested in finding out why it happened and who were responsible. They were only worried about their image,"" she said.

The woman said it was because of the help and support of her family and friends that she registered a case. ""I got in touch with an NGO, which alerted the American embassy, and forwarded my complaint letter to the Delhi police commissioner. But despite having written in by October, the FIR was delayed by a month and a half,"" she said.

Delhi police said the name of the NGO - American Overseas Domestic Crisis Violence Centre - had them confused that it was a complaint of domestic violence and they forwarded the mail to the women's cell.  A case was registered in November after the women's cell sent it back to the police and thereafter the woman's statement was sought from the NGO. She was later asked to come to India to identify the accused.

The police have questioned 11 men in the case so far, including the tour guide and the staff at the hotel. They however said arrests will only be made after the complainant identifies the accused.

""It took months. It was very frustrating the process of filing the case, not confident with the way Delhi police was handling it. But I stuck on as I want justice for what happened to me, and I know there are other victims of these people,"" the woman said.

Over 1,900 rape cases have been registered this year in Delhi alone.

""I was very excited when I came to India. It was my lifelong dream. I still have love for India as a country. But this problem the country has with rape and violence is a serious issue,"" the woman said.

A US woman who was allegedly gang-raped at a Delhi hotel will help the investigating team
New Delhi:
A 25-year-old US national, who was allegedly gang-raped earlier this year in a five-star hotel in New Delhi, arrived in the national capital this morning to join the investigation. She will be meeting the investigating team to help them pursue the case, said a senior police officer.

She had said earlier that she was not satisfied with the way in which the investigation had been carried out and was ready to come to India to identify the accused men.

On December 8, the tour guide, accused of raping her along with his accomplices, was questioned by the police after being brought back from Nepal. The police had identified the man and contacted him while he was in Nepal.

The tour guide had denied his involvement in the matter, and instead, told the police that the woman had given positive comments about him in the feedback form while returning to her country. He also said that an internal inquiry by the travel agency hadn't found him guilty.

The woman had alleged that she was raped by a group of men for two days. They also allegedly threatened her with dire consequences if she reported the matter to anybody. The woman had also stated that the accused had allegedly made a video of the act and had threatened to make it public if she reported the matter to anyone.

The gruesome gang-rape of 'Nirbhaya' on 16 December in Delhi drew the ire of people across India.
New Delhi:
Four years after the 16 December gang-rape and murder -- a case that shocked and enraged India and made international headlines -- the decision on fate of the five men found guilty of assaulting her is pending with the Supreme Court. The 23-year-old paramedical student, dubbed Nirbhaya, was gangraped and brutally tortured in a bus while returning with a friend after watching a movie in posh South Delhi. She had died 13 days later, on December 29, at a hospital in Singapore.
Following are the 10 developments in this story:
Of the six men arrested in the case, one was a juvenile. Another, Ram Singh, who was driving the bus, was found hanging in jail in March 2013. His lawyers had alleged that he had been murdered.
The other four -- Akshay, Vinay Sharma, Pawan and Mukesh -- were found guilty and sentenced to death by the Delhi High Court in September 2013.
The men have challenged the death sentence in Supreme Court, which is currently hearing their appeal.
The top court has put a freeze on the death sentence. The court said it would sit for extra time to hear their appeal.
In August, one of the convicts, Vinay Sharma, had taken a lot of painkillers and tried to hang himself with a towel in Delhi's high security Tihar Jail. He was spotted by the guards in time.
The alleged involvement of the juvenile - who was six months short of 18 years - had created a huge stir in the country, triggering a demand to give teeth to criminal laws. At the time, the maximum punishment for minors was three years at a reform centre.
Later, parliament amended the Juvenile Justice Act, under which minors aged 16 years or older can be tried as adults in cases involving heinous crimes like rape or murder. The decision whether a minor would be tried as an adult rests with the Juvenile Justice Board.
After serving the three-year term, the juvenile was released on December 2015, triggering widespread anger. But a court, while agreeing that the issue was serious, said after December 20, the juvenile cannot be kept at a special home as per law.
This year, the government has allocated Rs 200 crore to the fund set up in memory of Nirbhaya. The Nirbhaya fund, as it is known, supports government initiatives to protect women and children from sexual crimes and provide compensation for survivors.
The Nirbhaya case had drawn visceral response from the nation. Protests and candlelight marches held across all metros. The biggest of these were held in Delhi, where thousands of students braved tear gas shells and water cannons at the India Gate in bitter winter.

The two accused, including a juvenile, have been arrested.
New Delhi:
A 13-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her two friends, including a juvenile, who spiked her drink with sedative at a birthday party in west Delhi's Uttam Nagar area.
The survivor told police she was invited by her friend at his home for his birthday party on December 13 where she was offered cold drink laced with sedatives.
""She lost consciousness after she consumed it and she alleged that she was gangraped. They dumped her near a hospital in west Delhi,"" a senior police officer said.
The incident came to light around 3 pm when a passer-by found her on the roadside in distress.
She managed to reach home and informed her parents, who approached the police.
A case was registered under Section 376-D (gangrape) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act at the Uttam Nagar police station, said the officer.

The court refused to fram charges against the accused because of the delay in filing the FIR.
New Delhi:
A man accused of raping a 30-year-old married woman in 2010 after allegedly making her consume a sedative-laced drink has been discharged by a fast-track court in New Delhi which said there was no valid justification for a delay of six years in lodging the FIR.

Additional Sessions Judge Praveen Kumar refused to frame charges against the man, a Delhi resident, under sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 323(voluntary causing hurt) of the IPC, observing that the complainant did not raise an alarm nor lodge a complaint against him for the alleged offences for six long years.

""No complaint was lodged by the woman till May 27, 2016, though she was allegedly raped by the accused for the first time on June 16, 2010. As per prosecutrix, she was raped for the last time on May 21, 2016. There is no valid justification for the delay in lodging the FIR,"" the judge said.

It further said, ""the delay of one or two days in lodging the FIR may be bonafide, reasonable and justified in the facts and circumstances of a given case. However, in the present case, there is a delay of more than six years in lodging the FIR. Prosecutrix neither raised alarm/hue and cry nor immediately lodged report with the police against alleged forcible sex.""

The court also rejected the claim of the woman that the accused had threatened and blackmailed her all these years with their obscene videos, saying no such videos were recovered by the police during the investigation.

According to the prosecution, the woman, a mother of two children, lodged a complaint in May this year alleging that the accused, with whom she had professional relations, came to her house in June 2010 and after making her consume a sedative-laced drink, he raped her.

Thereafter, he repeatedly raped her while blackmailing her with their pictures and videos, she had claimed. During the proceedings, the accused had contended that he knew the complainant and he had helped her financially as she had problems with her husband.

When he asked her to return his money, she falsely implicated him in this case, he had said.

The judge, while passing the order, said, ""After sifting and weighing the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case is made out against the accused, I am of the opinion that the materials placed before the court do not disclose grave suspicion against the accused for framing a charge against him for committing the offences...Accordingly, accused in the present case is discharged.""

A Delhi court on Monday granted bail to former Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar
New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Monday granted bail to former Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar, who was arrested on the charge of rape.

Special Judge Poonam Chaudhry granted bail to Kumar, who was sacked from the Aam Aadmi Party government after the case came to light.

The former Social Welfare and Women and Child Development Minister, who was also suspended from the AAP, was arrested on September 3 on a complaint filed with the Sultanpuri police station in north Delhi by a woman who figured in a sex video with him.

He was booked under Sections 376 (committing rape) and 328 (causing hurt with poison, with an intent to commit an offence) of the Indian Penal Code.

The AAP legislator was also charged under Section 67-A (publishing or transmitting material containing sexually explicit act in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act and under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The woman said in her complaint that she was sexually harassed by Kumar at his office-cum-residence in the Sultanpuri area where she had gone to get her ration card made.

In his bail plea, Kumar said he was in custody for nearly two months whereas the case probe is still incomplete.

He said his conduct since the registration of a first information report had been good and unquestionable and he had himself surrendered before the police.

The Delhi Police, while opposing the bail plea, told the court he can try to influence witnesses and the complainant if released on bail.

The bail was granted as the court noted there was a delay in lodging of the FIR.
New Delhi:
A government land revenue official, accused of abducting and raping a woman tenant, has been granted bail by a Delhi court noting that there was a delay in lodging the FIR.

Additional Sessions Judge Sunil Kumar Aggarwal released the man, a resident of Rohini in northwest Delhi, after directing him to furnish a personal bond of Rs 50,000.

""No plausible reason has been offered for not specifying the rape incidents of December 2, 2015 and December 5, 2015 to the police on being called on December 10, 2015. Further delay of about one month therefrom in the registration of the FIR is crucial but unexplained,"" the court said, adding that the man was no more required for investigation.

During arguments on bail, advocate Pradeep Rana, who appeared for the accused, said when the woman had called the police regarding a quarrel between her and the landlord, she had not said anything about the alleged rape incident.

He also argued that the victim had refused to undergo medical examination.

According to the complainant, she was raped twice when she went to clean her landlord's house who was also residing in the same building.

She had alleged that he had locked her up and threatened to kill her if she disclosed the incident to anyone. An FIR was registered in the case on January 13 this year.

Anmol Ratan is accused of raping a woman in the hostel after spiking her drink.
New Delhi:
Jawaharlal Nehru University student Anmol Ratan was today put on trial, for allegedly raping a 28-year-old fellow student in the university hostel, by a Delhi court which kept bail plea pending till the recording of the woman's statement.

Additional Sessions Judge Devender Kumar Sharma framed charges against Mr Ratan for the alleged offences of rape and criminal intimidation under sections 376 and 506 of the IPC respectively.

The court framed the charges after the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The court fixed the matter for November 7 for commencement of trial by recording the testimony of the woman.

During the day, the court also heard arguments on the bail plea of Mr Ratan, who was represented through advocate Rajiv Mohan. The accused is currently in judicial custody.

The court kept the bail plea pending as the woman was yet to be examined as prosecution witness and the forensic report was also awaited.

The court had earlier taken strong exception to Delhi Police's failure to file forensic reports on time ""despite repeated warnings"" and had asked why cost should not be imposed on it for such inaction.

It had noted that in its charge sheet filed last month, the prosecution had not included the CFSL report, saying the police seemed to pay no heed for speedy trial.

While filing the final report, the police had told the court that call details of the woman and the accused, fingerprint report and other CFSL reports pertaining to the case were pending and the agency was likely to file a supplementary charge sheet in the matter.

The police had chargesheeted Mr Ratan for allegedly raping the woman in the Brahamputra Hostel, where he stayed, after offering her a spiked drink.

The court warned Rs 10,000 will be imposed on the Delhi Police in future if such failure recurs.
New Delhi:
A city court today took strong exception to Delhi Police's failure to file forensic reports on time ""despite repeated warnings"" and asked why cost should not be imposed on it for such inaction.

Additional Sessions Judge D K Sharma made the observation while hearing arguments on charge against JNU student Anmol Ratan for allegedly raping a 28-year-old fellow student at a university hostel.

It noted that in its chargesheet filed last month, the prosecution had not included the CFSL report, saying the police seemed to pay no heed for a speedy trial.

""It has been noted time and again that the prosecution has been directed to obtain expert's opinion on time but charge sheet is being filed without it. On numerous occasions, the concerned investigating officers (IOs), SHOs, ACPs and DCPs (of some districts including south and south west) have been warned in this regard but it appears that they do not pay any heed for the sake of speedy trial... A showcause notice be sent to all the concerned IOs, SHOs, ACPs and DCPs as to why the cost should not imposed for failing to file forensic reports,"" the court said, adding that a cost of Rs 10,000 will be imposed in future if such failure recurs.

The court, which was scheduled to hear Mr Ratan's bail application, posted the matter for hearing on October 17 after noting that counsel for the accused was not present before it.

While filing the final report last month, the police had told the court that call details of the woman and the accused, fingerprint report and other CFSL reports pertaining to the case were pending and the agency was likely to file a supplementary charge sheet in the matter.

The police had chargesheeted Mr Ratan for allegedly raping the victim. According to the charge sheet, the victim had written on her social networking website's wall that she wanted to watch a movie and had asked if anyone had its CD. Mr Ratan had then messaged her saying he had a copy.

Later, he picked her up on August 20 on the pretext of giving her the CD, took her to Brahamputra Hostel where he stayed, allegedly offered her a spiked drink and raped her, the charge sheet said.

Mr Ratan is currently lodged in judicial custody and his bail application is pending before a sessions court.

New Delhi:
A 47-year-old orthopedic surgeon of a civil hospital in Gurgaon was arrested from New Delhi on Sunday for allegedly raping a patient, police said.

The 44-year-old victim in her complaint to the police on Friday alleged she recently visited Dr Arvind Jindal at Gurgaon civil hospital following pain in her leg which was operated upon by him two years ago, a senior police officer said.

Mr Jindal advised her for an X-ray and when she visited the hospital with the report she was asked to wait.

When the hospital OPD closed, Mr Jindal took her to his friend in Dwarka on the pretext that he would help her get a job in an NGO.

Later, he took her to his flat in southwest Delhi's Dwarka area and raped her there, he said, adding the doctor also allegedly threatened her of dire consequences if she reported the matter to police.

Initially, she kept quiet but approached police on October 7, he said, adding the doctor was arrested the same day.

Kumar was arrested on September 3 on charges of rape after his sex CD surfaced.
New Delhi:
Sacked Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar, arrested on rape charges, will be produced in a Delhi court via video conferencing from jail following his apprehension of threat to life from his political opponents during transportation.

Special Judge Poonam Chaudhry allowed Mr Kumar's plea that he be produced before the court through video conferencing till the filing of charge sheet in the case, as the police did not object to it.

""In view of the facts and circumstances, the accused (Mr Kumar) need not be produced and further remand will be extended through video conferencing till the filing of charge sheet,"" the court said.

It also sent a notice to Tihar Jail superintendent directing him to file a report on Mr Kumar's plea, filed through advocate Pradeep Rana, seeking a separate van for his production from jail to court apprehending threat to life from supporters of other political parties and other miscreants during transportation.

The court extended Mr Kumar's judicial custody till October 19 after he was produced before it.

During the hearing, Mr Rana said some miscreants may try to harm Mr Kumar in the jail van and the case against him was ""politically motivated"".

The police, in its reply, said the remand proceedings could be done through video conferencing as a significant force was being deployed to produce the AAP MLA before the court.

Mr Kumar was arrested on September 3 after a woman lodged a complaint at the Sultanpuri police station in North Delhi alleging sexual harassment by the former Social Welfare and Women and Child Development minister, following which a case was filed. The woman had allegedly figured in an objectionable video with him. The AAP legislator had also been booked for rape.

The MLA from Sultanpur Majra was removed from AAP government and the party on August 31 by Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after the CD surfaced. He had defended himself saying he had been targeted.

Azam Khan will be served a notice by CBI to explain his offensive comments on rape, top court said.
New Delhi:
Azam Khan, the most senior minister in Akhilesh Yadav's cabinet, has run into more trouble with the Supreme Court today over his remarks about a woman and her teen daughter who were gang-raped on a major highway in Bulandshahr near Delhi in July.

Mr Khan, 68, will be served a notice by the CBI to explain his comments conflating the rape, which took place in Bulandshahr, with a ""political conspiracy"", judges said today.

Last month, the Supreme Court stopped the CBI's investigation while it determines if Mr Khan's remarks violate the right to free speech.

The court said it will examine whether a person holding a public office can make such comments which can impact the ""victim in distress"" and affect fair probe and whether a statement like that ""defeats constitutional sensitivity"".

The teen rape survivor, who was assaulted in fields near the highway with her mother, while men in their family were tied up by a gang of men, has said the Supreme Court must penalize Mr Khan for his comments and also monitor the investigation into her attack.  The minister's stand, she has alleged, proves the state will not conduct an impartial inquiry.

Mr Khan's self-defense has been centred on the argument that he ""spoke like a politician"".

The rape and the alleged police inaction has been used by other parties to buttress their claim of rampant lawlessness in Uttar Pradesh just months before the state votes for its next government.

A first-year Ph.D student of JNU was allegedly raped on August 20.
New Delhi:
Delhi Police today said it would file a charge sheet in a rape case against JNU student Anmol Ratan within ten days, as a Delhi court decided to hear his bail plea on October one.

Additional Sessions Judge Rakesh Pandit fixed the matter for the next date after the counsel for Ratan, accused of raping a 28-year-old fellow student in university hostel, told the court that he will argue on the matter once the final report is filed in the case.

Ratan, accused of raping a first-year Ph.D student on August 20, had surrendered before the police on August 25 and is currently in judicial custody.

The victim in her complaint at Vasant Kunj (North) police station had said she had posted on her Facebook that she wanted to watch a movie and had asked if anyone had its CD.

Ratan apparently messaged her saying he had a copy.

Later, he picked her up on August 20 on the pretext of giving her the CD and took her to Brahamputra Hostel, where he stayed. There he allegedly offered her a spiked drink and raped her.

Ratan, an AISA activist, was expelled from the association after being accused of rape.

New Delhi:
A special court hearing a rape case against Sandeep Kumar - filed by the woman purportedly seen in a sex tape with the ex-Delhi minister - has asked the Information Technology ministry to block all  links to the video.

The court's order came after a petition from Delhi Police seeking removal of objectionable video clips and links from the 'YouTube' in the case

""In view of submissions made, direction is issued to the Director of Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-IN), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India... to block/remove the above said links with immediate effect and compliance report be submitted ... to the investigating officer (IO),"" the judge said.

Delhi police, in its application, said the video clips mentioned in the application are ""highly objectionable, illicit and harm the modesty of a woman... They are thus required to be blocked/ removed from the Internet/ website immediately to maintain peace, law and order and modesty of a woman.""

Advocate Pradeep Rana, representing Mr Kumar, has denied the allegation that it was his client who was seen in the alleged objectionable videos.

Mr Kumar, 36, who was arrested on rape charges on the complaint of a woman, was today sent to 14-day judicial custody by the special court in Delhi after the police said he was not required for custodial interrogation.

He was arrested on September 3 after the woman approached Sultanpuri police station in North Delhi accusing Delhi's former Social Welfare and Women and Child Development minister of rape and harassment following which a case was filed.

Mr Kumar has been booked for rape, abuse of public office and under sections of the IT Act.

The National Commission for Women has accused Ashutosh of defending Sandeep Kumar.
New Delhi:
Aam Aadmi Party leader Ashutosh said today that he would appear before the country's top women's rights body to explain a column he wrote for ndtv.com on the removal of Delhi minister Sandeep Kumar over a sex scandal.

The National Commission for Women has called Ashutosh's comments ""reprehensible and demeaning"".

""I have decided to appear before NCW tomorrow as I have been asked by the panel, to present my views (sic),"" Ashutosh said in tweet today. He is scheduled to meet NCW chairperson Lalitha Kumaramangalam tomorrow at 11:30 am tomorrow.

Ashutosh's column for ndtv.com was published on Thursday before Sandeep Kumar, 36, was accused of rape by a woman who featured in a sex video with him.

Ashutosh, said in his blog that the sexual act was a private and consensual one, that the media over-reacted to the scandal and exaggerated its import, and that the party sacked Mr Kumar because of ""perception management.""

Speaking to NDTV on the summon last week, Ms Kumaramangalam said Ashutosh should ""admit to his mistake in defending the sacked minister'. She said the tone of the piece was derogatory towards women.

Ashutosh in response to the summons had tweeted on Monday saying, ""I hope Lalitha Kumarmangalam, member of BJP Nat Ex/chairman NCW is summoning every writer who wrote about consensual sex. NO pick and choose (sic).""

Ms Kumaramangalam has said Ashutosh was wrong to jump the gun and pronounce Sandeep Kumar innocent when a police investigation was on.

""The Commission has taken a note in the larger interest because we feel that as a spokesperson of a party, that governs Delhi and a party whose members have been accused of many incidents of violence against women, should not be writing a blog like this which reeks of patriarchy and misogyny."" she said.

Ashutosh's column elaborates on how neither the sexual habits nor romantic relationships of Indian politicians have historically not been a cause of public concern or judgement.  He lists the examples of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The Congress and the BJP say that Ashutosh has insulted Mahatma Gandhi by referring to him in the same breath as a man who is now accused of rape. In his blog, Ashutosh refers to Gandhiji's close ties with Sarla Chaudhary.

An Air Force officer has been granted anticipatory bail in a rape case lodged by his ex-lover.
New Delhi:
A flying officer of the Indian Air Force has been granted anticipatory bail in a rape case lodged by his ex-lover, with a Delhi court saying there was no apprehension that he will hamper the investigation as he was not posted in the national capital.

Additional Sessions Judge Shail Jain gave the relief to the defence officer after noting that there was no allegation that he had ever threatened or forced the woman to establish physical relations with him.

""Even during the arguments before the court, prosecutrix had admitted that she considered the accused to be her husband and only thereafter the relationship was established between them.

""Considering the fact that applicant-accused is a Flying Officer (Indian Air Force) working at Air Force Pune, there are no chances of his evading the process of law or interfering in the administration of justice or to threaten the witnesses as he is not posted in Delhi,"" the court said.

The judge said it was a fit case for admitting the man to anticipatory bail and granted the relief on furnishing of a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and two sureties of like amount.

The prosecution opposed the bail plea saying the man established physical relations with the woman from September 2013 to January 2016 by giving a false impression that she was married to him.

Advocate Pradeep Rana, who appeared for the man, sought anticipatory bail for the officer on the ground that the relationship between the parties continued for nearly three years during which they stayed in different hotels.

He argued that it was nowhere mentioned in the FIR, registered at Tilak Nagar Police Station in west Delhi, that the man established physical relations with the woman by forcing or pressuring her.

The counsel said the accused was a flying officer in IAF and there were no chances of his absconding or tampering with the evidence.

The prosecution said the man and the woman met through social networking website and fell in love, but when their families got to know that they belonged to the same village and community, they refused to accept their marriage.

The man claimed they had mutually decided to end their relationship but when the woman came to know that the man's parents were looking for a matrimonial match for him, she could not accept it and lodged an FIR with the police.

Sacked Delhi Minister Sandeep Kumar has been sent to one day police custody after sex tape case.
New Delhi:
Wife of sacked Delhi Minister Sandeep Kumar, who has been arrested on charges of raping a woman, has come out in support of her husband, saying that he has been ""falsely implicated"" in the sex tape scandal.

""My husband is innocent, I stand by him. Rape charges against my husband are wrong,"" said Ritu Kumar on Sunday.

Mr Kumar, 36, has claimed innocence. He was produced in a Delhi court on Sunday which sent him to police custody for a day. The Aam Aadmi Party has cancelled Mr Kumar's party membership and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has recommended ""exemplary punishment"" if proven guilty.

Mrs Kumar said the charges were part of a political conspiracy and her husband was innocent. She said the entire family was with Mr Kumar at this hour.

In her complaint, the 40-year-old woman, who is from Himachal Pradesh but has lived in Delhi for almost 20 years and has two children, said she had gone to meet Mr Kumar at his Sultanpuri office for a ration card 11 months ago. She alleged that Mr Kumar gave her a spiked drink after which she fell unconscious. Mr Kumar, she alleged, then took her to his house where she was raped and filmed.

Mr Kumar, who joined the Delhi cabinet as its youngest minister, has been booked on charges of rape, transmission of material containing sexually explicit act and taking illegal gratification.

Ex-AAP leader Sandeep Kumar has been arrested after a police complaint today by a 40-year-old woman alleged that she was drugged, raped and secretly filmed about a year ago by the Delhi lawmaker, who was sacked by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over the sex scandal.

The woman, said, she was approached by an NGO after the video became public and was advised to file a case.

""This incident happened last year after Sandeep Kumar had become a minister. The woman has filed a complaint at Sultanpuri police station and Sandeep Kumar has been booked for rape, amongst other charges,"" said deputy Commissioner of Police Vikramjit Singh

The woman has told the Delhi Police that the nine-minute video that led to Mr Kumar's removal as Delhi's minister for women and child development, was filmed without her knowledge after he allegedly spiked her drink and forced himself on her.

The woman is from Himachal Pradesh but has lived in Delhi for almost 20 years. She is married and has four children. She has told the police that the video is from about a year ago, when she had met Mr Kumar because he had promised to get her a ration card.
    
Sandeep Kumar, 36, has denied that he is the man in the video and has alleged that he is being targeted because he is a Dalit. The Aam Aadmi Party suspended him from membership of the party this morning.

Soon after the case was registered, Mr Kejriwal said in a tweet, ""If the woman's allegations are correct, this is very serious. Strongest exemplary punishment should be given to Sandeep.""

In a video message to workers earlier Mr Kejriwal accused Mr Kumar of ""betraying the Aam Aadmi Party and our movement.""

""We will never ever compromise on our core values. We will prefer to die than tolerate wrongdoings,"" Mr Kejriwal said.

Sandeep Kumar is the third minister to be sacked by Mr Kejriwal since his government took office in February last year.

Jitender Tomar was asked to resign as Law Minister after he was accused of forging his college degree. In October, Asim Ahmed Khan was removed as Minister for Food and Environment following allegations of taking a bribe from a builder.

There are six ministers in the Delhi government who hold multiple portfolios. AAP is now looking for a Dalit lawmaker to replace Sandeep Kumar.

Anmol Ratan, an AISA activist, was expelled from the association after being accused of rape.
New Delhi:
Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) student Anmol Ratan, accused of raping a 28-year-old fellow student in the university hostel, was today remanded to 14 days judicial custody by a Delhi court.

A magisterial court at Patiala House courts complex sent Mr Ratan to jail after Delhi Police decided not to seek his custody.

The court also directed jail authorities to provide him proper medical facilities after he submitted that he was suffering from a heart ailment.

Mr Ratan, accused of raping a first-year Ph.D student on August 20, had surrendered before the police last night, hours after the victim recorded her statement before a magistrate.

The victim in her complaint at Vasant Kunj (North) police station had said she had posted on her Facebook that she wanted to watch a movie and had asked if anyone had its CD.

Mr Ratan apparently messaged her saying he had a copy.

Later, he picked her up on August 20 on the pretext of giving her the CD and took her to Brahamputra Hostel, where he stayed. There he allegedly offered her a spiked drink and raped her.

Mr Ratan, an AISA activist, was expelled from the association after being accused of rape.

The accused had contended physical relations between him and the woman were consensual
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has discharged a 37-year-old man, accused of raping his 63-year-old ex-wife, a German national, saying there was an inexplicable delay of three years in lodging FIR in the case.

Additional Sessions Judge Praveen Kumar, while discharging the accused, a Delhi resident, also noted that there was no medical evidence to support the allegations of rape against him.

""The delay of one or two days in lodging the FIR may be bonafide, reasonable and justified in the facts and circumstances of a given case. However, in the present case there is a delay of about three years in lodging FIR,"" the judge said.

""After examining the documentary as well as oral evidence ...it is not showing that accused committed the alleged offences for which he is being prosecuted because there is no valid justification for delay in lodging the FIR.

The court further said the evidentiary value of medical evidence is zero and the consent was obtained on pretext of marriage, so it cannot be said to result from misconception of fact in the facts and circumstances of this case.""

""I am of the opinion that the materials placed before the court do not disclose the grave suspicion against the accused for framing a charge against him for committing offence punishable under section 376 of the IPC,"" the judge said.

The court's order came on a complaint of the German woman alleging that she came to India in 2001 and met the accused in a hotel at Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh and they married each other in 2005.

However, they got divorced in 2007, but later in September 2012, they met again and the accused established physical relation with her against her consent with a promise to remarry her, but again ditched her, the complaint said.

An FIR in the case was lodged in 2015 on the complaint of the woman under sections 376 (rape) and 420 (cheating) of India Penal Code.

The court discharged him under section 376 but directed him to appear before another magisterial court to be tried for the offence of cheating.

The accused, while denying the rape allegations, had contended that the physical relations between them after divorce were consensual.

File photo of 2012 Delhi gang-rape convict Vinay Sharma
New Delhi:
Vinay Sharma, one of the four men sentenced to death for the gang-rape, torture and killing of a young medical student in 2012 in what came to be known as the Nirbhaya case, allegedly tried to hang himself with a towel at the high security Tihar jail in Delhi on Wednesday.

Sharma, a former gym instructor, allegedly took excessive painkillers. He was spotted by guards while he was trying to hang himself in his cell. Sources say he is on depression medication.

Last year, he had demanded more security in jail alleging that he had been beaten up by other inmates. Tihar officials denied it, saying he is in solitary confinement and constantly monitored by CCTVs.

Another convict Ram Singh, the driver of the bus in which the woman was assaulted, was found hanging in the same complex in March 2013.

Six men were found guilty of raping and torturing the 23-year-old physiotherapist, who was on her way home after watching a movie on a winter evening. She died in hospital 13 days later. As street protests raged through a shocked nation, the government introduced major changes to laws on crimes against women.

Reacting to the alleged suicide attempt, the woman's father told news agency IANS: ""He has to die in future, if he dies today, it would be a tribute to our daughter. Such people are dangerous for society and country.""

Her mother said: ""The sin of these people will not allow them to live. My daughter survived without water for 13 days. She faced extreme pain and brutality.""

Vinay Sharma and the other convicts, Mukesh Singh, Akshay Thakur and Pawan Gupta, have appealed against their death sentence in the Supreme Court.

The youngest of the rapists, who was a few months short of 18 when he was arrested, was released last year after three years in probation, amid protests by hundreds including the woman's parents.

The court said the minor cannot be held guily of perjury on account of the POCSO Act.
New Delhi:
A sessions court in Delhi has acquitted a young man of a rape charge and has ordered a woman and her mother to be booked for allegedly forcing the woman's minor girl to make a false rape charge.

Observing that the two women had misused the legal machinery, Additional Sessions Judge Rakesh Pandit on Monday ordered that the minor girl's mother and grandmother, who were prosecution witnesses in the case, be tried for misuse of legal provisions.

The court acquitted Akash Chauhan of the charges of rape, criminal intimidation and violation of the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Mr Chauhan, 22, was facing trial for allegedly raping his 12-year-old cousin in August 2015.

The minor, her mother and grandmother had turned hostile during the trial and deposed that Mr Chauhan did not rape the girl.

The two women told the court that on August 15, 2015, there was a quarrel between them and Mr Chauhan's mother after he beat up the girl for breaking his cell phone.

Mr Chauhan admitted he beat up the girl and said rape charge against him was false.

The court said the girl's grandmother went to police station and lodged the sexual assault complaint against Mr Chauhan.

""...in the given circumstances, it appears that both these witnesses (mother and grandmother) have misused the legal machinery...It appears PW2 (girl's mother) and PW3 (grandmother) had conspired and falsely implicated the accused (Akash Chauhan) by abetting the PW1 (girl) to level false charges against the accused,"" the court said.

""In these circumstances, let a complaint under Section 340 (procedure of offences relating to documents given in evidence) of Code of Criminal Procedure be made against PW2 and PW3.""

The court said the minor cannot be held guily of perjury on account of the POCSO Act.

Film director Mahmood Farooqui was convicted of raping a US scholar on July 30.
New Delhi:
A court in Delhi on Tuesday fixed August 4 for pronouncing the punishment for Mahmood Farooqui, co-director of the 2010 Hindi film 'Peepli Live', convicted for the rape of an American woman.

Additional Sessions Judge Sanjiv Jain reserved his order after the defence and prosecution concluded their arguments on the quantum of punishment.

Mr Farooqui was convicted of rape on July 30.

The prosecution demanded maximum punishment, saying he had committed a grave offence.

The complainant's counsel also told the court that Mr Farooqui must be awarded the maximum punishment as he had raped a foreign woman he had invited to dinner and thus had ""betrayed the friendship and trust of the woman"".

On the other hand, Mr Farooqui's counsel sought leniency, saying the convict had maintained good conduct during the trial and also not tried to intimidate the victim.

Mr Farooqui was charged with the rape of the 35-year-old woman from Columbia University who was in India for research work for her doctoral thesis.

The woman moved to Delhi in June 2014 and was looking for contacts for her work in Gorakhpur. She came in contact with Mr Farooqui through a common friend.

The crime dates back to March 28, 2015, when Mr Farooqui invited her for dinner at his house.

Police said in its chargesheet that she reached the director's house at 9 p.m. on that date and found him very intoxicated. He asked her to go to his office in the other room.

He later forced himself on her, the prosecution said, adding the woman was scared after the incident.

During the trial, the American researcher stood by her complaint and reiterated that Mr Farooqui raped her. He denied the charge and claimed he was falsely implicated.

1 16-year-old girl was raped and set ablaze in Delhi.
New Delhi:
A 25-year-old garment sewing unit owner has been arrested for killing a 16-year-old girl by setting her ablaze after raping her, police said on Monday.

The accused, Danish, was arrested on Sunday from his residence in east Delhi's Gandhi Nagar.

Deputy Commissioner of Police Rishipal said that Danish burnt the girl on July 28 to destroy evidence of rape. He was the girl's neighbour.

""The girl's partially burnt body was found lying on a cot inside her second floor house. She had returned home from school at about 1 pm and was alone as her mother and brother had gone for work. The accused sexually assaulted her and then burnt her by pouring kerosene on her body,"" the officer said.

The officer said they got a clue about Danish while interrogating one of the victim's friends who informed that he sought sexual favours from her. ""She had made allegations against Danish and his brother Ashu for sexually exploiting her,"" the officer said.

The officer said that they have registered a fresh case on the allegation of the victim's friend and arrested Ashu.

The officer said that Danish, who runs a small garment unit in Gandhi Nagar for sewing clothes, used to bully others in the locality to maintain his dominance.

New Delhi:
A rape case has been filed in Delhi against former Uttarakhand minister Harak Singh Rawat. The case was filed last night after a 32-year-old woman lodged  a complaint.

The woman has alleged that the former minister raped her at his Green Park residence, said a senior police officer.

Mr Rawat had joined the BJP after playing a key role in challenging the Harish Rawat government earlier this year.

The former agriculture minister had a case of molestation filed against him in Delhi in 2014. The woman, said to be in her late twenties, had alleged that Mr Rawat had molested her at his residence in September when she had gone to meet him for a job. Sources close to Mr Rawat had claimed that the case was politically motivated.

Family members said the attack last week was retaliation for not withdrawing the case.
A 20-year-old college student was found in the roadside bushes of a small northern Indian city last week, raped and left for dead. In the days afterward, a shocking possibility came to light: Her attackers may be the same five men who had raped her three years earlier but were out on bail. They allegedly raped her again because she had been so steadfast in her case against them.

Heinous rape cases periodically find airtime in the Indian news cycle, but the outcry is often muted when the victim belongs to a lower caste. The unnamed girl in this case is a Dalit, a term used to describe the lowest rungs of India's caste system. Casteism is outlawed by India's constitution, but the practice is widespread, especially in smaller towns and rural areas. The five men whom the girl's family blames for the rapes belong to the upper castes.

According to local media interviews with the girl's family, two of the five accused were arrested in 2013 after the first incident of rape but were let off on bail.

Family members said the attack last week was retaliation for not withdrawing the case. Instead of settling the matter in court, the five men had wanted to do so out of court, the victim's family members said. The accused wanted to pay about $75,000, a great deal of money in a country where the average annual income hovers about $1,500, but the victim's family members said they repeatedly rejected the offer.

""We had filed a case in the court for the arrest of the remaining three and re-arrest of the two out on bail. We were getting constant threats from the accused to reach a compromise outside the court, but we remained firm. That's why they have attacked her again,"" the victim's brother told the Hindustan Times.

Rohtak, the place where the rape occurred, is outside Delhi, in a state known for its deeply chauvinistic attitudes and patriarchal prejudices - where male-dominated village councils often mete out their brand of misogynistic justice with impunity.

The victim's family said this week that her attackers took her from outside her college, drugged her and raped her in a car.

The victim was interviewed in her hospital bed and could barely speak. She was able to tell a TV crew that she went unconscious during the rape but could not muster any more words. Her mother said she had relocated her family to Rohtak after the first rape for safety and better education prospects.

The woman was gang-raped by five men, who were out on bail, in Haryana's Rohtak.
Rohtak:
A 20-year-old Dalit woman was raped by five men and left to die in the bushes in Haryana's Rohtak, around 60 km from Delhi, this week.

But what is even more shocking is that the men who are accused are the same five who had raped her earlier in 2013.

According to the survivor's family, the men, who are all in their twenties and out on bail, wanted them to settle the case and were punishing the woman for pursuing it in court.

""I came out of college and there were those very five men in the car. Three were inside and two of them were outside,"" the woman told NDTV.

They took her inside the car, drugged her and then raped her while she was unconscious. They then dumped her body near the bushes, she said.

According to the survivor's family who moved to Rohtak after the incident three years ago, the five men, all of them from an upper caste, were threatening the family to negotiate a settlement worth Rs 50 lakhs.

""We used to live in Bhiwani before. After the incident we fled to Rohtak to save ourselves from these men. I wanted to educate my children,"" the mother of the woman said.

The police say the woman was found in the bushes in Rohtak's Sukhpura Chowk area on Wednesday, after which she registered a complaint and is now in a government hospital.

""We will file an FIR (First Information Report). A team has been sent to Bhiwani to look for the accused,"" Garima, a police officer, said.

The High Court said that ""deliberate improvements"" were made by the woman on material points related to the case and her testimony does not inspire confidence. (File photo)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has acquitted a man, who was jailed for 10 years by a trial court for raping a woman in 2011, observing that she was in a live-in relationship with him and her statement regarding the alleged incident was suffering from ""serious infirmities"".

The court set aside the order passed by the trial court in 2013 in which it had convicted the man for alleged offences under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and had awarded him a 10-year jail along with a fine of Rs 15,000.

""From the above documents (referred in the judgement), which have not been considered in right perspective by trial court, it is clear that the prosecutrix (woman), who had been living alone away from her husband in Delhi, was in live-in relationship with the appellant (man),"" Justice Pratibha Rani said.

While allowing the appeal filed by the man against his conviction, the High Court said that ""deliberate improvements"" were made by the woman on material points related to the case and her testimony does not inspire confidence.

According to the police, an FIR was lodged on the basis of woman's statement in which she had alleged that the incident took place on the intervening night of January 13-14, 2011, when she was alone at her house and was mourning the death of her daughter who had expired a few days back.

She had claimed that the door of her house was open and the accused entered her room and raped her.

The accused had denied the allegations levelled against him and during arguments on the appeal, his counsel said that the woman was in a live-in relationship with his client.

The lawyer argued that prior to the incident, the woman had borrowed Rs 11,000 from the man and after he insisted on repayment, she falsely implicated him in the case.

Opposing the appeal, the police had argued that the man had committed the crime when the woman was alone in her house. In its verdict, the High Court noted that the woman had changed her version at every stage and the man was well known to her.

""She admitted having received Rs 11,000 on October 31, 2010 i.e. much prior to the alleged rape incident on the night intervening January 13-14, 2011. Thus, her statement that this amount was paid to her for changing her statement is falsified from the record,"" the court said.

New Delhi:
The Delhi Commission for Women on Wednesday recommended registration of an FIR against India Hockey captain Sardar Singh in an alleged sexual assault case after a British woman Hockey player of Indian origin filed a complaint against him.

DCW chief Swati Maliwal also demanded that an FIR be registered against Punjab Police for failing to register the first information report (FIR) against Singh despite the woman alleging rape and assault in January 2016.

""The woman has given us a complaint and alleged that she was physically assaulted by Singh and that there was an attempt to push her from the top floor of a five-star hotel in Delhi and that she was raped by Singh therein. We have recommended registration of an FIR against Singh to SHO Chanakyapuri police station (in Delhi),"" Maliwal said, adding that the Police Commissioner and his deputy have also been marked in the directive.

""Also, the law clearly states that if a woman says that she has been raped, police has to file an FIR. But the Punjab Police did not do so despite the woman approaching them and even upon revelation of cognisable offence.

""We demand that an FIR be registered against Punjab Police under section 166A of IPC for failing to register an FIR,"" Maliwal said.

Justice should be delivered in a fast track manner, she said.

The Commission also issued a notice to Hockey India president Narinder Batra on Wednesday and sought an explanation with regard to the allegations made by the complainant against HI and the action taken or proposed to be taken by it in the matter.

The 21-year-old complainant was the first British-Asian woman to represent England in hockey in 2010 as part of their junior women's team. She had filed a police complaint in February in Ludhiana following which an SIT was formed to probe the sexual harassment allegations. The SIT had given a clean chit to the Indian hockey team skipper.

Sardar has earlier denied all the allegations levelled against him, saying that the charges were 'inappropriate' and 'false'.

The Commission also sought to know the policy followed by HI for handling complaints of sexual harassment and assault by team members of the Indian hockey team and whether it has constituted an 'Internal Complaints Committee' for handling cases of sexual harassment as per the Sexual Harassment at Workplace Act.

It also sought the information regarding the policy followed by HI regarding the benefits, travel facilities, hotel facilities and accompaniment policy of wives and girlfriends of the India men's hockey team.

The woman in her complaint has alleged rape, physical abuse and criminal intimidation by Singh and informed the Commission that she got pregnant in 2015 with Singh's child and upon the revelation of the same to the accused, he threatened her and forced her to abort the pregnancy.

In addition, she has alleged that HI has taken no action on her complaint, despite knowing about these incidents and that HI has facilitated her travel to various destinations and stay in hotels to accompany Singh during his hockey matches.

The complainant has also informed the Commission that HI had taken no action on a complaint she had sent to the organisation in May 2016.

Talking to reporters, she claimed that despite providing police with all the evidence, they did not file any FIR. ""I was sent from SHO to ACP, then to the DCP and well way to DGP of Punjab Police, I also met the Ludhiana Police Commissioner,"" she claimed.

Ludhiana Police, she said, instead asked her to go and register a complaint at either Panchkula or Sirsa police station under the Haryana police.

New Delhi:
A court in Delhi convicted five men on Monday for the gang-rape of a 52-year-old Danish tourist in 2014.

The five were found guilty of the rape, kidnapping, and robbery of the Danish woman, who was attacked at knife-point after losing her way while returning to her hotel in central Delhi.

""I pronounce all the accused guilty. Arguments (on sentencing) to be held on June 9,"" Additional Sessions Judge Ramesh Kumar told the court in Delhi where media and family members of the accused had gathered.

The judge convicted them for the offences under sections 376 (D) (gang rape), 395 (dacoity), 366 (kidnapping), 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

The convicts -- Mahendra alias Ganja (27), Mohd Raja (23), Raju (24), Arjun (22), Raju Chakka (23) -- were present in the court.

Three others charged over the attack are being tried separately under the juvenile justice system. A ninth accused, an adult, died before the trial ended.

The Danish woman, travelling alone, had come to Delhi after visiting the Taj Mahal. She had approached a group of men for directions.

According to the prosecution, the five accused, all vagabonds, had robbed and gangraped the Danish tourist at knife-point on the night of January 14, 2014, after leading her to a secluded place close to the Divisional Railway Officers' Club near New Delhi Railway Station.

The prosecution had examined 27 witnesses in support of its case while the accused had opted not to lead any evidence.

The five accused, escorted by the police into court, showed little emotion when the verdicts were read out today.

Neither the victim nor members of her family were in court for the verdict.

The CCTV footage helped in nabbing the accused of the brutal rape of an 8-year-old, who was abducted outside her home.
New Delhi:
An eight-year-old girl was abducted from outside her home in outer Delhi and raped on Saturday. Brutalised, the girl underwent an emergency surgery and had severe injuries. CCTV footage helped the police identify the accused who has now been arrested and sent to judicial custody. It was the girl's presence of mind that saved her as she pretended to play dead and somehow managed to get home after the accused fled assuming she had died.

Last week, a 13-year-old girl had similarly been raped and beaten and left for dead near the railway tracks in Pul Prahladpur in south-east Delhi.

These two cases, in the same week, reflect a long and exhausting list of cases of child sexual abuse in the capital. As per Delhi Police data, between 2012 and 2015, 5217 cases were registered under the 'Protection of Children Sexual Offences (POCSO)' law that aims to address sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children.

But 3191 cases are pending in courts and investigation is pending in as many as 575 cases in three years.

331 new cases have been registered in just the month of April this year.

Child Rights activist Bharti Ali said the problem is multi-layered and plays out at many levels.

""Currently, Delhi has one court per district but that handles cases related to sexual abuse of children, but it also has to deal with all kinds of other cases too. So either we get more courts dealing with POCSO cases or have more exclusive cases just for these,"" she said.

New Delhi:
A court here on Wednesday set June 6 for delivering its verdict in the 2014 Danish woman's gang rape case.

Additional Sessions Judge Ramesh Kumar reserved the order after defence counsel and prosecution concluded their final argument.

Arjun, Raju alias Chhakka, Mohammad Raja, Mahendra alias Ganja, Raju alias Bajji and Shyam Lal were accused of robbing and raping the Danish woman at knife-point near New Delhi railway station in January 2014 after she sought directions to her hotel in Paharganj in central Delhi.

Shyam Lal died in February in the Tihar jail here and proceedings against him in the case were abated.

Three minors are also facing proceedings before the Juvenile Justice Board in the case.

Police said all the accused are vagabonds who took the woman to an isolated spot near the Divisional Railway Officers' Club close to the railway station, took away her belongings and then raped her.

Shiv Kumar Yadav was arrested on December 7, 2014 from Mathura. (File Photo)
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court today dismissed the bail plea of Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav who was sentenced to jail for remainder of his life for raping a 25-year-old woman executive in his taxi in 2014.

A bench of Justices Pradeep Nandrajog and Mukta Gupta, however, admitted Mr Yadav's appeal challenging his conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court.

The trial court had on November 3 last year awarded the sentence to 33-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav observing that his acts were ""against the society"" and should be dealt with an ""iron hand"".

During the hearing, the counsel appearing for Mr Yadav told the bench that the sentence awarded to his client should be suspended and he should be granted bail during the pendency of appeal.

His lawyer claimed there were improvements in the woman's testimonies which was recorded by the police and the one recorded before a magistrate.

Besides the jail term, the trial court had also imposed a fine of Rs 21,000 on Mr Yadav who was convicted for the offences under sections 376 (2) (m) (while committing rape causes grievous bodily harm or disfigures or endangers life of a woman), 366 (abducting with an intent to compel her for marriage), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 323 (causing hurt) of IPC.

The incident had taken place on the night of December 5, 2014 when the victim, a finance executive working in Gurugram, was heading back to her house at Inderlok in Central Delhi.

Mr Yadav was arrested on December 7, 2014 from Mathura and was in judicial custody since then.

The woman had told the trial court that on the day of the incident, after finishing her office work she had gone to Gurgaon for a party with friends and had booked an Uber cab for returning to her house in Inderlok in Delhi.

She boarded the cab, which was being driven by Mr Yadav, from Vasant Vihar area and fell asleep in the car, she had told the trial court, adding that when she woke up she found Mr Yadav was also sitting on the back seat and when she tried to raise an alarm, he slapped her repeatedly and threatened to insert a rod while reminding her of December 16, 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape case.

The woman had said that the car was stopped at a secluded place and Mr Yadav raped her and dropped her to her house.

New Delhi:
The Delhi Police on Wednesday argued in a court that the testimonies of a 52-year-old Danish woman and an eyewitness clearly nail the accused facing trial for allegedly raping the foreigner in 2014.

Commencing final arguments in the case, Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said the scientific and medical evidence collected in the case also prove the guilt of the five adult accused persons.

""The foreign national was ravished in India. Her testimony coupled with the depositions of witness who had seen the accused committing the crime and the hotel manager who had seen the woman in an injured condition when she returned there after the incident are enough to convict the offenders,"" the prosecutor argued before Additional Sessions Judge Ramesh Kumar.

He said the woman had clearly identified three of the six adult accused in the court while she was not completely sure about others.

""She had left India immediately after the incident. We had requested her to undergo medical test but she had refused as she was traumatised. She was medically examined when she reached Denmark and the officers there also saw that she was in a bad condition mentally and physically which showed she was ravished,"" Mr Shrivastava said.

The prosecutor's arguments remained inconclusive and would continue on May 6.

According to the prosecution, the nine accused, all vagabonds, had allegedly robbed and gangraped the Danish tourist at knife-point on the night of January 14, 2014, after leading her to a secluded spot close to the Divisional Railway Officers' Club near New Delhi Railway Station.

All nine accused were arrested. The five adult accused - Mahendra alias Ganja (26), Mohd Raja (22), Raju (23), Arjun 21), Raju Chakka (22) - are in judicial custody and facing trial. 55-year-old accused Shyam Lal, who was in judicial custody, died in February.

Three other accused were juveniles against whom inquiry before the Juvenile Justice Board is in progress.

The matter of appeals of four convicts against the Delhi High Court order upholding their death sentence is listed for next hearing on July 18. (File photo)
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court today appointed two amicus curiae on appeals of four convicts in the December 16 gangrape and murder case against the Delhi High Court order upholding their death sentence.

A bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra appointed senior advocates Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde as amicus curiae to assist the court in the matter.

While Mr Ramachandran would assist the court in appeals of the convicts --Mukesh and Pawan, Mr Hegde would appear for convicts Vinay and Akshay in the case.

""We must express our concern in the matter. We feel the gravity in the whole issue. Sometimes there are many perceptions and we don't want to miss anything. We would like to be assisted by the amicus curiae in the matter. We appoint two senior counsels Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde as amicus in the case,"" the bench, also comprising Justice V Gopala Gowda and Kurian Joseph, said.

The matter is listed for next hearing on July 18. On April 4, the court had commenced arguments on the plea of Mukesh and Pawan.

Besides Mukesh and Pawan, the other two convicts, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Kumar Singh, had approached the Apex Court against the Delhi High Court's March 13, 2014 verdict, which had termed that their offence fell in the rarest of rare category and upheld the death sentence awarded to them by the trial court.

A 23-year-old paramedic was brutally assaulted and gangraped by six persons in a moving bus in South Delhi and thrown out of the vehicle with her male friend on the night of December 16, 2012. She had died in a Singapore hospital on December 29.

The prime accused, Ram Singh, had been found dead in a cell in Tihar Jail in March 2013 and proceedings against him were abated.

On August 31, 2013, another accused, a juvenile at the time of the crime, was convicted and sentenced to three years in a reformation home. He was released from observation home in December last year.

Another FIR was registered against unknown persons on the alleged gang-rape by Jat agitators in Murthal on February 22.
Chandigarh:
For the first time since reports alleged that women were pulled out of cars and raped in Murthal near Delhi at the height of the Jat quota agitation, a police case has been filed.

An FIR or First Information Report was filed on the statement of a tour operator from Delhi.

The witness, Bobby Joshi, has reportedly told a Special Investigation Team that he had met some people near Murthal's Sukhdev Dhaba - one of the most popular roadside eateries in the Haryana town - who told him that a mob had looted vehicles and dragged women passengers towards the fields.

A special team of women police officers was asked to inquire into the allegations after contradictory reports on what happened in the early hours of February 22 when the mass rapes allegedly took place.

A newspaper report had said that cars were stopped by a mob of 30 and at least 10 women were dragged out and raped in the fields. Images of innerwear scattered on the fields, circulated on social media, were cited by some as proof of the rapes.

Reports quoted ""eyewitnesses"" as saying that the women lay in the fields almost till dawn until their families came looking for them.

An NGO said that its members spoke to witnesses who confirmed the rapes.

Taking note of the allegations, the Punjab and Haryana High Court asked Haryana's Chief Secretary and police chief to submit a report.

On March 17, the government said in its report that some women were harassed but there was no strong evidence to suggest they were raped.

The police also said the clothes scattered on the field were believed to have been looted from a shop near the alleged site of the crime.

About 40 per cent of women surveyed in Delhi said they have been sexually harassed in a public place such as a bus or park in the past year. (Representational image)
Washington/New Delhi:
Sexual harassment remains a pervasive problem in Delhi despite tougher laws being enacted after the gruesome rape and murder case in 2012, according to a new study that found 40 per cent of female respondents were sexually harassed in the past year.

About 40 per cent of women surveyed in Delhi said they have been sexually harassed in a public place such as a bus or park in the past year, with most of the crimes occurring in the daytime, researchers said.

Further, 33 per cent of women have stopped going out in public and 17 per cent have quit their jobs rather than face harassment in public places.

""What this means is that women, despite Nirbhaya, are still afraid,"" said Mahesh Nalla, from the Michigan State University in US.

Nirbhaya became the pseudonym given to the gang-rape victim whose death in 2012 brought worldwide attention to violence against women.

""Women in India do not feel safe being in public spaces, which is clearly a human rights issue,"" Mr Nalla said.

While sexual harassment is a problem experienced by women worldwide, it may be more prevalent in emerging democracies such as India and other countries in South Asia where women are becoming more involved in the workforce, said Mr Nalla.

""The problem is intensified by the existence of a cramped, inadequate public transportation system, massive youth migration to urban areas and the fact that India is a traditional patriarchal society where many still believe a woman's place is in the home,"" he said.

Mr Nalla and Manish Madan, assistant professor at Stockton University, surveyed about 1,400 men and women in the capital city of New Delhi on a host of issues including perceptions and history of sexual harassment, use of public transportation, safety in public spaces and police effectiveness in dealing with these concerns.

Researchers found that 40 per cent of female respondents were sexually harassed in the past year and 58 per cent were sexually harassed at least once during their lifetime.

Respondents were asked to gauge the seriousness of sexual incidents ranging from whistling to asking a woman for sexual favours to patting her buttocks or squeezing her breasts.

While both men and women generally considered all incidents serious, men considered them considerably less serious, illustrating ""a disjunction between how males and females think,"" Mr Nalla said.

Sexual harassment of women in public spaces in India and elsewhere in South Asia - known as ""Eve teasing"" - has long been a common occurrence, particularly by groups of young male perpetrators, he said.

The December 16, 2012 rape and murder by a group of men on a moving bus in Delhi brought about new laws for rape and criminalised voyeurism and stalking.

However, despite these efforts, sexual harassment continues on a broad scale, the study suggests.

The research was published in the journal International Criminal Justice Review.

The woman had earlier deposed in the court that she had made the complaint against the man as he was delaying their marriage.
New Delhi:
A man, accused of raping a woman on the false promise of marriage, has been acquitted after the alleged victim told a Delhi court that the physical relations between them were consensual and now they are happily married.

The court also absolved the man's aunt of charges of abetting the woman's kidnapping and rape, saying the factum of abetment of the offence by her has also not been proved.

""For the foregoing reasons, particularly in the light of deposition of the prosecutrix, wherein she admitted consensual physical relations with the accused during her relations with him, coupled with her voluntary depositions to the extent that she had made the complaint against the accused merely under the impression that he was not marrying her and had obtained her consent for physical relationship on the false promise of marriage..., I find there is no material on record whatsoever for convicting the accused for the offence with which he was charged,"" Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja said.

According to police, the man was a friend of the woman's brother and after developing friendship, they were in touch through calls and social media and he proposed her for marriage.

It alleged that the man, a resident of central Delhi, established physical relations with the woman against her wishes on the pretext of marriage and also made a video and started threatening her not to disclose it to anyone or he would upload it on Internet.

When the woman became pregnant, she pressurised him for marriage but he kept delaying it and got her pregnancy terminated. Later in April 2015, he refused to marry her, it said, adding that the woman then lodged a complaint to police.

The woman, however, deposed in the court that she had made the complaint against the man as he was delaying their marriage and asking her to wait but now he has married her and they were living happily.

She added that physical relations between her and the man were consensual and she had voluntarily terminated her pregnancy as she was unmarried at that time.

She was declared hostile and was cross-examined by the prosecutor but she failed to support the case of prosecution.

The judge said the consent of the victim to establish physical relations with the accused appears to be voluntary and uninfluenced by any promise or assurance.
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has acquitted a man of the charges of raping a woman on false pretext of marriage observing that the two, being in the prime of their youth, had consensual intimate relations in ""youthful eagerness"".

Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhatt, while acquitting Haryana resident Vikul Bakshi on the basis of the victim's ""contradictory and inconsistent"" statements, said the prosecution failed to prove charges against the accused.

""It appears that the two, being in the prime of their youth, were having sexual relations with each other in youthful eagerness and nothing else,"" the court said.

It further said, ""There is no evidence on record to suggest that the prosecutrix had given her consent to physical relations with the accused solely on the latter's promise to marry her or that he was having knowledge that she consented to physical relations with him only on promise to marry her.""

The judge said the consent of the victim to establish physical relations with the accused appears to be voluntary and uninfluenced by any promise or assurance.

According to prosecution, the woman had lodged a case against Vikul Bakshi under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code alleging that the accused forced upon her twice against her consent on false pretext of marriage and threatened to defame her if she insisted upon marrying her.

However, relying on the messages exchanged between them on social networking sites, the court said it ""clearly indicates that the prosecutrix herself was eager to have sexual relation with the accused and she was not doing so on any promise of marriage with him.""

The court said the perusal of these messages show that these are not normal routine messages and the woman and the accused have been discussing the manner in which they would enjoy the intimate act.

""Hence these messages demonstrate that the prosecutrix was a consenting partner to physical relations with the accused and she herself had been eager to enjoy sex with him and the plan to have sexual encounter December 11, 2014 had been made well in advance and it was not spontaneous,"" it said.

The police had on June 19 lodged a First Information Report against Mr Farooqui on the complaint of the woman.
New Delhi:
A US researcher was sexually assaulted by 'Peepli Live' casting director Mahmood Farooqui, whom she had trusted and considered a friend, the Delhi Police told a court here today.

In final arguments in the case, the prosecution said that the woman has been consistent in her statements at every stage of trial in which she has reiterated that she was allegedly raped by Mr Farooqui at his residence on March 28 last year.

Advocate Vrinda Grover, appearing for the researcher, argued, ""The court needs to understand that she is an American woman who is honest and consistent in sharing the sterling quality of her evidence. She has not concealed any fact and her conduct needs to be understood in the cultural context.""

Ms Grover added that the testimony of the victim was the most importance evidence in the case and the ""court should see that the woman came for research work in India which is not her society, her family.""

The counsel also argued that no clear motive has been attributed as to why the woman would falsely implicate Mr Farooqui, whose interim bail expires tomorrow. The prosecution arguments remained inconclusive and would continue tomorrow.

The trial in the case had commenced on September 9 last year and the alleged victim, based in the US, had appeared in the court on September 14 to record her statement.

The 30-year-old American woman had, during the in-camera proceedings, alleged that Mr Farooqui had raped her at his Sukhdev Vihar residence here on March 28 and later apologised to her in the several e-mails exchanged between them. Mr Farooqui has denied the allegations levelled against him saying he was falsely implicated by the woman.

The police had on June 19 lodged a First Information Report against Mr Farooqui on the complaint of the woman after which the filmmaker was arrested.

On July 29, a charge sheet was filed against Mr Farooqui alleging he had raped the research scholar from Columbia University at his house in south Delhi.

The court also stressed on the need to protect men from such cases in which they are falsely implicated, saying it was time to take a stand.
New Delhi:
A lawyer has been acquitted in a rape case by a Delhi court, which said it was time to take a stand to protect men from such false implications.

The court, which said the lawyer may file a case for damages against the complainant, made the observation in the rape case lodged by the woman after she retracted from her complaint.

The woman had alleged that she was repeatedly raped in the chamber of the accused at a court in New Delhi from 2010-2012.

Additional Sessions Judge Nivedita Anil Sharma said, ""It can't be ignored that accused, a lawyer, due to this case...has suffered humiliation, distress and misery besides expenses of litigation.""

""His plight may also continue after his acquittal as his implication may have caused an uproar in society but his acquittal may not even be noticed. He would continue to suffer the stigma of being a rape case accused,"" the judge said, adding, ""It may not be possible to restore his dignity and honour nor compensate him for humiliation, misery, distress.""

The court also stressed on the need to protect men from such cases in which they are falsely implicated, saying it was time to take a stand.

""No one discusses about dignity and honour of a man as all are only fighting for the rights, honour and dignity of women.""

""Laws for protection of women are being made but where is the law to protect a man from such a woman where he is being persecuted and implicated in false case, as in the present case. Perhaps, now it is the time to take a stand,"" it said.

According to the prosecution, the woman, who was working as a clerk with the accused, had lodged a complaint alleging she was repeatedly raped for two years by him and he had also threatened to kill her if she disclosed the same to any one.

Charge sheet was filed against the accused under sections 376(2)(n) (repeatedly raping a woman), 354A (sexual harassment), 354D (stalking), and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

The woman, however, turned hostile before the court saying accused was innocent and she lodged a complaint out of anger.

""The evidence of prosecutrix makes it highly improbable that such incident ever took place. She has categorically deposed that the accused has not raped her nor threatened her to kill her and her family. She did not have any grievances against the accused. She has even prayed for his acquittal,"" the court noted.

The court further said, ""Statement under section 313 of the CrPC of accused is dispensed with as there is nothing incriminating against him.""

The girl (centre) is a class 5 student and wants to soon start her school again.
New Delhi:
A 13-year-old girl who survived after being gang-raped for days, shot twice and then thrown into a well allegedly by three men in Greater Noida, says she wants to fight back.

All three accused, aged between 24 to 35, have been arrested and charged for rape of minor, abduction and attempt to murder, police said.

The girl was allegedly abducted by the three men who came in a white SUV when she had gone to grocery shop in West Delhi's Uttam Nagar on November 22 and held captive in a house in Greater Noida for two weeks.

In her statement to the police, she described the room as dark, where she said the men took turns to rape her. They abused her and did not give her anything to eat for over four days, the girl has alleged.

""After a fortnight of repeated abuse, one night they said they will let me go. They put me in the car and drove to a store to buy alcohol and then parked the car near a well,"" the girl told NDTV.

Describing the horrific incident, she said, ""They told me they will let me go but as I took a few steps back, they fired two shots. At first I didn't feel a thing, my body went numb but after the second bullet, I fainted.""

The men then dragged her and threw her into the well and left the scene. Hearing her scream, the nearby villagers rescued the girl from the well and admitted her to a hospital on the morning of December 6. Despite losing a lot of blood, the teen survived the hard landing and the bullets.

""I felt a bullet lodged in my chest and yanked it out. The other bullet grazed my armpit. I wanted to live and fight the injustice,"" she said.

The girl's mother who also spoke to NDTV said that she had to borrow Rs 50,000 to pay for her daughter's treatment. After being treated for her injuries for over a month, the student of class 5 wants to start school again.

""I want the rapists to be hanged. No one should go through what I did,"" said the teenager, who is determined to fight for justice.

The vote came at the end of a debate piloted by Maneka Gandhi, who made a strong pitch for it saying it could not be ""more nuanced and compassionate.""
New Delhi:
The Rajya Sabha today passed by voice vote the Juvenile Justice Bill, amending the law to try 16 year olds accused of serious crimes such as rape and murder, as adults. The Lok Sabha has already  passed the bill, which will now be sent to the President for ratification.

Present as the upper house debated the Bill were Asha Devi and Badrinath, the parents of Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old medical student who was gang-raped and tortured by six men on a moving bus in Delhi on December 16, 2012. She died in a Singapore hospital 13 days later.

""I am satisfied that the bill has been passed, and other young girls will get justice. But I am sad that my daughter did not get justice,"" said Jyoti's mother Asha Devi.

Jyoti's parents have spearheaded the demand for a change in the law. While Jyoti's other attackers have been sentenced to death, the youngest was released on Sunday after three years in a remand home. Now 20, he was not tried in court for the brutal rape and murder as he was a few months short of 18 at the time of the attack.

Today's amendment will not affect the juvenile offender. But there have been massive protests over his release and public sentiment brought pressure on political parties as they debated the change in law.  

The Congress, crucial to any vote in the Rajya Sabha because of its superior numbers, supported the bill, though many of its leaders had said they favoured sending it to a parliamentary panel called a select committee.

The Left walked out before the vote after its suggestion that the bill be sent to a select committee for review was rejected.   

Former top cop Kiran Bedi tweeted, ""But for Nirbhaya's parents the Juvenile Justice Bill would never have been passed by Rajya Sabha with the sense of urgency it did today.""

""I am happy that every party has supported it and I thank all of them,"" said Maneka Gandhi, union minister for women and child development, who piloted today's debate, making a strong pitch for the bill.

The youngest Delhi gang-rape convict was a few months short of 18 years when he and five others raped 23-year-old Jyoti Singh.
New Delhi:
A petition to stop the release of the youngest of six men who gang-raped and tortured a student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012 was rejected today by the Supreme Court, which questioned: ""Under what jurisdiction can we extend his detention?"" The convict, now 20, was released on Sunday from a correctional home - where he spent three years - to a non-profit organization.
Here are the 10 latest developments:
Rejecting the Delhi Commission for Women's request to keep the convict in detention, the Supreme Court indirectly blamed Parliament, saying: ""In the absence of any law we can't take away the right of a person. There has to be legislative sanction.""
In a petition filed after midnight on Saturday, the women's panel had said that the convict had shown no remorse and should be under observation till his mental condition is assessed. The court said: ""If the reformation programme takes 7 or 10 years, can we keep him under detention? Where is the legislative sanction?""
A bill to change the law and treat convicts who are 16 and above like adults in crimes like rape and murder will be taken up in Parliament tomorrow. It has been passed by the Lok Sabha but is pending in the Rajya Sabha, which has barely functioned in the ongoing winter session due to repeated disruptions.
The mother of Jyoti Singh, the 23-year-old medical student who died days after the savage assault in 2012, said people would lose faith in law. ""They have handed a certificate to those under 18 years to rape our women and girls,"" said Asha Devi, crying bitterly.
Jyoti's parents joined protests at Jantar Mantar this evening. There were also protests yesterday at the India Gate mirroring the massive demonstrations after the gang-rape in 2012. Hundreds were detained during Sunday's protests led by Jyoti Singh's parents. Asha Devi was injured while she was being taken away by the police.
The convict was just a few months short of 18 when he and five others assaulted Jyoti Singh and tortured her with an iron rod on the night of December 16, 2012, before dumping her and her male friend on the road, naked and bleeding. She died 13 days later at a Singapore hospital.
The juvenile was sentenced to three years in a correctional home, the maximum punishment under India's law for criminals below 18.
On Friday, the Delhi High Court had also refused to stop the convict's release, saying he cannot be kept in further detention by law. The court said he would be monitored by the Juvenile Justice Board with help of an NGO until the Delhi government prepares a post-care plan.
The government has said a one-time financial grant of Rs. 10,000 and a sewing machine will be given to him so he can make a living as a tailor.
Four other convicts have been sentenced to death and a fifth was found dead in prison.

The youngest rapist in the December 16 gang-rape was released from a correctional home on Sunday.
Jammu:
On a day that the youngest rapist in the December 16 Delhi gang-rape case was released from a correctional home, the BJP today advocated for changes in the country's juvenile justice system so that the underage who commit heinous crimes are not allowed to walk free.

""Incidents like Nirbhaya should not be repeated in the country, being a juvenile should not be an excuse to set a criminal free. The law must be changed and the law should punish such a criminal so as to send a good message,"" BJP National Vice President Shyam Jaju told reporters in Jammu today.

Asked why juvenile justice system was not being amended when his party was in power at the Centre, he said, ""legal justice system does not work with the interference of any government, it works as per law and there should be change in it"".

Mr Jaju said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was very 'sensitive' toward the issues of women security in the country and changes in the laws protecting women would be made in the days to come.

He termed as ""not true"" the allegations levelled by the opposition parties that the NDA government was 'misusing' the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for political vendetta.

""There is not a single example (of the misuse of CBI). The 18-months-long tenure of Narendra Modi so far there is not a single instance when the CBI has been misused,"" he said.

The BJP leader accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of spreading lies on the issue of CBI raid at the office of the Principal Secretary, saying the raid was on a 'corrupt officer' and not on the office of the Delhi Chief Minister.

""If a corrupt officer of Arvind Kejriwal is raided, he (Kejriwal) has a habit of speaking lies as he says that his office was raided, the raid was on his Secretary,"" he said.

""The language he (Kejriwal) used against the prime minister and the allegations he levelled against him will not be tolerated by the people of this country,"" he said.

The man has signed a consent form to be in the care of the NGO, in view of what the police say is a serious threat to his life. (File photograph)
New Delhi:
Release papers were signed at 5 pm on Sunday for the youngest convict in the December 16 gang-rape case. The convict, who was in the custody of Delhi Police for security purposes for the last week, was handed over to a Delhi-based non-profit organisation.

The man was a few months short of 18 years on December 16, 2012, when he and five others had raped 23-year-old Jyoti Singh. He was freed on Sunday after the Delhi High Court refused to stay his release, saying the law doesn't allow keeping him in further detention.

Now an adult, the man has signed a consent form to be in the care of the NGO, in view of what the police say is a serious threat to his life.

The court had asked Delhi government to prepare a plan for his rehabilitation. Till the plan is ready, he will be under the care of the non-profit.

At the NGO, he is expected to undergo vocational training and attend classes on mental health. Sources in the NGO told NDTV that their task is to make him self-sufficient and ready to rejoin society. During this period he will be under constant watch.

All of this could, however, change if the Supreme Court decides in favour of the plea filed on Saturday by the Delhi women's commission.

The plea, which will be heard today, objects to the release, saying during his stay in the correctional home, the convict showed a lack of remorse about his action and he has been further radicalised.

There were protests yesterday against the man's release at India Gate, led by parents of Jyoti Singh, who had died 13 days after the brutal assault. The police later rounded up the protesters and evicted them from the venue after a brief detention.

The maximum punishment under the Juvenile Justice Act is three years' confinement at correctional homes. But the minor's participation in the crime had triggered a nationwide debate on treating juveniles as adults in cases of heinous crimes.

A bill to this effect has been passed by Lok Sabha but is still pending in the Upper House of Parliament.

New Delhi:
The mother of a medical student who was raped and tortured on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012 has said the women's panel's late night plea in the Supreme Court against the release of the youngest convict in the case is ""just for show"" and added that the government ""has failed us.""

""What's the point of filing the plea so late if the hearing will take place after his release? They (women's panel) acted too late and only after we protested. It was just for show. They knew he is going to be released and had enough time to act,"" Asha Devi told NDTV.

The convict, now 20, was just a few months short of 18 when he and five others attacked 23-year-old Jyoti Singh and her male friend on the night of December 16, 2012. He is scheduled to be released around 5 pm today from a correctional home after three years. Four of the rapists have been sentenced to death and a fifth was found dead in prison.

Late last night, the Delhi Commission for Women filed a plea in the Supreme Court challenging the High Court's Friday order which refused to restrain the release of the convict. After it was reviewed post midnight, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the plea on Monday, but declined to give it an urgent hearing or stay his discharge.

Swati Maliwal, the chief of the women's panel has said consultations with legal team caused delay in filing the plea. ""It's really sad if Jyoti's mother feels this was a pretense. I did everything in my capacity, from writing letters to meeting the Vice-President. The fact that the court has decided to hear us first thing on Monday is a win for us,"" she said.

She also said the panel hopes the government and the Delhi Police will not release the convict till the matter is sub-judice.

Yesterday, Jyoti's parents and a group of around 40 students protested outside the reform home where the juvenile convict was kept but they were asked to move out by the police. They will lead a protest at India Gate today.

Jyoti was called Nirbhaya or fearless as she battled her grievous injuries in hospital. She died 13 days after she was brutally attacked on the night of December 16, 2012.

The youngest of the six men who gang-raped Jyoti Singh was yesterday shifted from reform home to an undisclosed location.
New Delhi:
The youngest of the six men convicted for raping and torturing a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012 is set to be released today from a correctional home. Late last night, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a plea against his release on Monday, but declined to give it an urgent hearing or stay the discharge.

In a last-ditch attempt to stall the scheduled release, Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the High Court's Friday order that refused to restrain the release of the juvenile convict and appealed for an urgent hearing. The petition was reviewed around 1.30 am by a two-member vacation bench who scheduled the hearing for December 21.

The mother of Nirbhaya, whose real name is Jyoti Singh, has said the women's panel move was ""just a pretense"" and added that the government ""has failed us"".  ""They (women's panel) acted too late and only after we protested. It was just a pretense to show they are with us,"" Asha Devi told NDTV.

Yesterday, Jyoti's parents and a group of around 40 students protested outside the reform home where the convict was kept but they were asked to move out by the police. This evening, they will lead a protest at India Gate.

Ms Maliwal has said they moved the court late in the night after consulting their legal team. ""It's really sad if Jyoti's mother feels this was a pretense. I did everything in my capacity. The fact that the court has decided to hear us first thing on Monday is a win for us,"" she said. She also said the panel hopes the government and the Delhi Police will not release the convict till the matter is sub judice.

The convict, now 20, was just a few months short of 18 when he and five others attacked Jyoti Singh on the night of December 16, 2012. Yesterday, he was shifted from the reform home to an undisclosed location yesterday due to ""security concerns"", sources said. After his release, he is likely to be monitored by the Juvenile Justice Board.

The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea against the release of the juvenile convict in the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case on Monday.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a plea by the Delhi Commission for Women against the release of the juvenile convict in the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case on Monday. However, the court hasn't put a stay on juvenile's scheduled release from his reform home today at 5 pm.

Swati Maliwal, the chief of the women's panel, in a last minute effort to stop the release had filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court and also met Chief Justice TS Thakur. The petition was reviewed by a two-member vacation bench of Justice AK Goel and Justice UU Lalit who scheduled the hearing for December 21.

The youngest of the six men, now 20, who gang-raped and tortured Jyoti Singh, was shifted from the reform home in the national capital earlier today to an 'undisclosed location' due to security concerns, sources said.

The parents of 23-year-old Jyoti Singh, Asha Devi and Badrinath, were removed from outside the reform home in Delhi on Sunday where they were protesting against the release. They were taken to the Maurice Nagar police station and let go after about an hour.

Jyoti was called Nirbhaya or fearless as she battled her grievous injuries in hospital, before dying 13 days after she was brutally attacked by six men on the night of December 16, 2012.

Of the six men convicted, one died in jail while four have been sentenced to death. The youngest was several months short of 18, the age at which a person can be tried as an adult, and he was sent to a remand home for three years.

He is likely to be monitored by the Juvenile Justice Board, which will decide on his rehabilitation, ""social mainstreaming"", and even whether he should be returned to his family. The post-care policy has to be formulated by the Juvenile Justice Board and the Delhi Government in consultation with the convict and his family.

The man's punishment is seen as disproportionate to the enormity of his crime by many and has led to a debate about whether India is too soft on teen offenders involved in serious crimes like rape and murder.

Jyoti's parents have spent the last three years demanding that the juvenile not be released. After the high court's ruling on December 18, Asha Devi said, ""A criminal who committed a heinous crime has been let off by the Court and the Government. The assurance that we were given that we will get justice has not happened.""

Ms Maliwal also sought President Pranab Mukherjee's intervention for the quick passage of the Juvenile Justice Amendment Bill.
New Delhi:
Delhi Commission for Women today sought intervention of President and the Chief Justice of India against releasing of the juvenile convict in the December 16 gang-rape case, saying he must be kept in observation home until his reformation is ascertained.

Terming the Delhi High Court's refusal to stay the release of the juvenile as a ""dark day"" in the history of the country, DCW chief Swati Maliwal wrote letters to President Pranab Mukherjee, Chief Justice of India TS Thakur and the Principal Magistrate of Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) Murari Prasad Singh.

""In light of the particularly heinous nature of the crime executed by this boy, the DCW requests your Hon'ble self to kindly intervene in the matter and ensure that the boy be kept in the observation home at least until his mental frame of mind and reformation is properly ascertained,"" she said in her letter.

""If your Hon'ble self deems fit, a committee may be set up consisting of the DCW and the Delhi State Legal Services Authority (DSLSA) with directions to create a team of the best counsellors from across the country to visit the boy at the home and assess the current mental state of the boy and the quality of reformation that he has undergone,"" she said.

The findings of the team may assist your Hon'ble self in taking a decision in the case, Ms Maliwal added.

Referring to the High Court order, Ms Maliwal said that though she understands that both the governments and the courts are bound by the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, it was necessary to assess the mental condition of the youth in larger public interest as he is viewed as a threat to the society.

Ms Maliwal also sought President Pranab Mukherjee's intervention for the quick passage of the Juvenile Justice Amendment Bill.

""It is imperative that the Juvenile Justice Amendment Bill which seeks to reduce the juvenile age to 16 years in certain categories of cases is pending with the Rajya Sabha is passed along with the requisite amendments for putting in place strong review mechanism of the mental reformation undergone by a juvenile convict before his or her release. I request you to kindly intervene for the quick passage of the said Bill,"" she said in the letter.

The DCW chairperson said that ""recently Nirbhaya's parents had met me and expressed their deep anguish over the imminent release. Their anger and anguish is shared by many citizens of Delhi, including me. In addition, people are unaware of the supposed reformation the said boy has undergone and worry about him repeating the offence.

""Since the status of the boy's mental reformation has not been properly ascertained, in larger public interest it may be pertinent to detain him at least until the same is done,"" she said in her letter.

Brushing aside the public outcry against his release, the Delhi High Court today said BJP leader Subramanian Swamy's plea seeking stay on the release of juvenile convict cannot be allowed as the statutory and existing law was coming in its way.

DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal stressed that an analysis needs to be carried out to assess the mental health of the juvenile convict.
New Delhi:
The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) today said the High Court's refusal to stay the release of the juvenile convict in the December 16 gang-rape case was a ""dark day"" in the history of the country and it would appeal against his release.

DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal said she would appeal to the Chief Justice of India, Delhi High Court and write to the President against the release of the juvenile.

""Extremely sad dat Nirbhaya's convict will walk free on 20th. Dark day in history of the country. Will be appealing to Chief Justice of High Court n Supreme Court and President to intervene. Nirbhaya rapist should not be released,"" she tweeted.

Allegedly the most brutal of all the six rapists, the juvenile convict, now 20, is likely to walk free on Sunday after his three-year sentence at a correction home gets over.

Ms Maliwal stressed that an analysis needs to be carried out to assess the mental health of the juvenile convict.

""Some kind of a analysis needs to be done as to what kind of a reformation this man has gone through. We are hounded by emails, messages and calls from women who are feeling scared with the very fact that this man will come out in open, he could be travelling in a taxi or a bus. India needs to know what reformation he has gone through,"" she said.

The convict along with five others had gang-raped and murdered the 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus, an incident that shook the nation and led to protests in the country as well as abroad.

He was sentenced to three years in a reform home, a punishment which drew criticism from several quarters saying it was not adequate and disproportionate in view of the heinous crime he had committed and there were demands of him being tried in an adult court.

Following the incident, government had proposed amendments to the Juvenile Justice Act, so that teenagers involved in heinous crimes can be tried as adults.

The parents say they will continue the fight and decide further course of action after discussing with their lawyers.
New Delhi:
""We haven't got justice,"" said Asha Devi, the distraught mother of Jyoti Singh after the Delhi High Court ruled today that the youngest of six men who brutally gang-raped her daughter on a moving bus in 2012 cannot be kept in a special home any more.

Today's court order means the convict, now 21, will be released from the remand home where he has been kept for the last three years. ""We agree it is a serious issue. But after December 20, the juvenile cannot be kept at a special home as per law,"" the High Court said today, also ordering that a rehabilitation plan be worked out for him.

Outside the High Court, Jyoti's mother looked shattered as she said, ""Despite our efforts, a heinous convict is now released. The court abandoned us. We did not get justice.""

""We are upset but what can we do? We are bound by the court order. The court is bigger than us,"" said Badrinath, Jyoti Singh's father. But he also said that their fight was far from over.

""Two-year-old children are being raped by people who get away because they are juvenile. Our fight will continue. We will talk to our lawyers before deciding our further course of action,"" he said.

The convict was a few months short of 18 when he and five others attacked Jyoti Singh, a 23-year-old medical student, on December 16, 2012. She died 13 days later in a Singapore hospital. The incident led to massive protests and demands for more stringent anti-rape laws.

While one of the men who attacked Jyoti died in jail, four have been sentenced to death. The juvenile was sentenced to three years in a reform home.

Since her death, Jyoti's parents have led a demand for a change in the law so that teenagers involved in serious crimes can be tried as adults. They have demanded that their daughter's rapist must not be set free and if he is, his name and identity must be revealed.

The convict was below 18 when he and five others attacked Jyoti Singh and her friend
New Delhi:
The youngest of six men convicted of raping and torturing a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi in 2012, is set to be released on Sunday from a correctional home, after the high court said it could not extend his three-year stay in a reform home.

""We agree it is a serious issue. But after December 20, a juvenile cannot be kept in the special home per law,"" the court said today, rejecting a petition by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy.

The rapist, now 21, is likely to be monitored by the Juvenile Justice Board, which will decide on his rehabilitation, ""social mainstreaming"", and even whether he should be returned to his family.

Legal options to stop his release are open till Sunday and both the Delhi government and the state Women's Commission are considering them.

The convict was just a few months short of 18 when he and five others attacked 23-year-old Jyoti Singh and her male friend on the night of December 16, 2012, an incident that shook India to the core and led to protests in the country as well as abroad. Four of the rapists have been sentenced to death and a fifth was found dead in prison.

The youngest convict's punishment was seen as disproportionate to the enormity of his crime and led to a debate about whether India was too soft on teen offenders involved in serious crimes like rape and murder.

For three years, Jyoti's parents Asha Devi and Badrinath had fought to stop the release of the juvenile. ""The court abandoned us. We did not get justice. Despite all our efforts, the criminal will get away with what he did,"" her mother Asha Devi said, looking shattered.

""I don't see the point in moving the Supreme Court,"" said Badrinath.

A bill that proposed to punish criminals between 16 and 18 as adults in serious crimes has not been taken up in Parliament, where the Rajya Sabha has barely run in this winter session.

The juvenile convict is scheduled to be released this month.
New Delhi:
The National Human Rights Commission today issued conditional summons to the Delhi chief secretary, police commissioner and the Union home secretary following their ""failure"" to produce reports on the release of juvenile convict in December 16, 2012 gangrape case.

The Commission had issued a notice to these authorities on November 20, giving them two weeks' time to respond after taking cognizance of the ""fears expressed"" by parents of the victim.

The NHRC has now asked the city and state authorities to submit the same by the December 21 or personally appear before it.

The parents had requested the Commission to recommend to the government to prepare a plan to protect the citizens from such delinquent juveniles post their release and also to strengthen the extant laws on the subject.

On its part, the Commission had asked Delhi chief secretary to apprise it of any pre-release or post release plan prepared for the juvenile and also sought information as to whether the juvenile has been recently subjected to "" psychological or psychiatric assessment"".

The Union Home Secretary was asked by the Commission whether it had taken any action based on the representation submitted by the parents of the victim to the Home Minister. The Commission had observed that ""there is no doubt that the complainants have undergone extreme agony and pain after the incident of rape and murder of their daughter. The fears expressed by them need to be looked into.""

Meanwhile, the Centre had yesterday asked Delhi High Court to extend the observation home stay of the juvenile convict who is scheduled to be released on Sunday, saying several mandatory aspects were missing from the post-release rehabilitation plan which needed to be considered before setting him free.

The court was hearing its verdict on BJP leader Subramanian Swamy's PIL seeking stay on the juvenile's release and reserved its verdict on it.

Delhi was the center of a nationwide protest following the rape and torture of a 23-year-old medical student in December 2012.
New Delhi:
Amid apprehension raised by Delhi braveheart's parents, the Union Home Ministry is contemplating to ask the juvenile convict to sign a legal bond affirming good behaviour after his release.

The bond as per Section 107 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) will act as security for keeping the peace after his release from a juvenile remand home.

""The Ministry is mulling on the option in this regard as it is legally not possible to keep him behind the bars,"" a senior official said.

As per the CrPC provision, when an Executive Magistrate receives information that any person is likely to commit a breach of the peace or disturb public tranquillity and is of opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding, he may, require such person to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond, with or without sureties, for keeping the peace for a period not exceeding one year.

The juvenile, who was under 18 when he was arrested for rape and murder of the girl, was tried under the Juvenile Justice Act and ordered to keep in a remand home for three years. He is set to be released this month.

The convict was allegedly radicalised by a fellow inmate, raising concern in the security establishment.

The gang-rape incident had caused wide public outrage across the country.

Union Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi had recently stressed the need to keep a ""close watch"" on him following his impending release.

The girl, who was brutally assaulted by six persons, including the juvenile, in a moving bus in South Delhi, had succumbed to her injuries in a Singapore hospital after battling for life for 13 days.

The court said the consent given by the victim was not voluntary as the convict had falsely made her believe that he was unmarried and would marry her after she obtains divorce from her husband.
New Delhi:
A woman's consent taken on the basis of deception and misconception is ""no consent"" in the eyes of law and the physical relations established between her and a man amounts to rape, a Delhi court has said.

The court, while holding a man guilty of raping a woman, said the consent given by the victim for cohabitation was not voluntary as the convict had falsely made her believe that he was unmarried and would marry her after she obtains divorce from her husband.

""The consent given by the prosecutrix to cohabitation with the accused can, by no means, said to be voluntary. It is clearly hit by section 90 (consent known to be given under fear or misconception) of the IPC and the said consent is no consent in the eyes of law as the same was obtained by the accused by practising deception and misconception.""

""Therefore, acts of physical relations between the accused and prosecutrix tantamount to offence of rape as defined under section 375 of IPC. The accused is guilty of the offence of rape,""Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said.

The court said prosecution has been able to prove that Uttar Pradesh resident Naim Ahamed had deceived the woman causing her to falsely believe that he would marry her after she obtains divorce from her husband. She was thus made to cohabit with him whereas he had no intention to marry her as he was already happily married, it said.

The court would pronounce its order on sentence later this week.

According to the prosecution, the woman alleged that Naim, who was staying near her house, had befriended her six years ago and had concealed his marital status.

She alleged that he persuaded her to divorce her husband, with whom she had three kids, and after assuring to marry her, he started having physical relations with her.

When she got pregnant, he reiterating that he would marry her after she gives birth to their child but when she divorced her husband, Naim started ignoring her and later went missing.

In 2012, when she went to his native place in his search, she got to know that the man was already married and had kids.

Police said the woman was illiterate and had no means to maintain herself as well as the minor child and took shelter in a government shelter home.

Feeling cheated and exploited, she lodged a complaint at Bindapur Police Station in south west Delhi this February.

During trial, Naim had denied the allegations.

Manish Sisodia said that the Bill will now be sent to President through the Lieutenant Governor.
New Delhi:
Delhi Assembly on Monday passed a Bill proposing amendments in the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), setting up another flashpoint with the Centre, as it seeks to broaden the scope of magisterial probes into cases of kidnapping, rape and disappearances.

The Opposition BJP accused the Aam Aadmi Party government of ""challenging"" the authority of Parliament by empowering itself through the move. CrPC is a subject in the Concurrent list.

Till now, magisterial probe is ordered only in cases of custodial death, homicide, suicide of a woman or death of a woman.

Through the amendment to section 176(1) of CrPC the government wants to widen its scope to cover any other cases of suspicious disappearance, rapes in police custody, suspicious death, Delhi Home Minister Satyender Jain, who tabled the Bill, said.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that except three issues - police, land and law and order, the state government has the power bring amendments in laws governing other areas.

""No question should be raised over the power of Delhi Assembly,"" he said. Mr Sisodia said that the Bill will now be sent to President through the Lieutenant Governor.

""It is up to President whether he pass or reject this Bill on the advice of Centre,"" Mr Sisodia added.

Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta lodged his protest against the Bill saying only Parliament has powers to amend the CrPC.

""By introducing this Bill the Delhi government is challenging the authority of parliament. It is disrespect of Parliament,"" he said.

Significantly, he assured the government of assistance provided it approaches through the ""proper channel."" ""In that case we will approach the Centre as well for the amendments,"" he said.

The government also tabled the Delhi (Right of Citizen to Time Bound Delivery of Services) Amendment Bill under which officials are liable to pay penalty for delay in providing services included in the citizens' charter.

It also seeks to ensure ""automatic and mandatory"" compensation for people doing away with the need to separately apply for it.

The Bill envisages entrusting a Competent Officer with the purpose of effecting payment of compensation to an individual and recovery of the compensation from the officer or person responsible.

Director Vibha Bakshi's film, Daughters of Mother India, also won the Best Documentary Award at the New York Indian Film Festival.
Washington:
Rape is not just India's problem but a global issue over which ""there is a conspiracy of silence,"" the director of a national award-winning film based on the events following the 2012 Delhi gangrape has said.

""We did made notorious headlines (after Nirbhaya's rape). We were being perceived as the rape capital of the world. That is not true. Let's not paint everyone with the same brush,"" said Vibha Bakshi, the director of 'Daughters of Mother India' which won the 62nd National Film Award for Best Film on Social Issues.

""If there is something very bad that has happened, that does not make us the rape capital. That's why I say let's look at it as a global issue. It's every body's problem,"" Ms Bakshi said after the screening of the documentary at the Indian Embassy.

A former journalist, Ms Bakshi said it was her consciousness after the horrific rape in Delhi on December 16, 2012, that made her work on the documentary. ""It (rape) is not just India's problem. It's a global issue,"" she said.

""Everyone felt hope is necessary. The change is not going to be dramatic. It's not going to be overnight. But it will happen,"" she added.

Ms Bakshi said there is more awareness against rape in India. ""Rape is across classes. 97 per cent of the rapes are within your safe zone. A case like Nirbhaya is only three per cent. There is a conspiracy of silence. The dialog has started, but this conspiracy that surrounds this issue needs to be broken,"" she said.

Her documentary film also won the Best Documentary Award at the New York Indian Film Festival.

Before the screening of the film, India's Ambassador to the US, Arun K Singh, said that although the issue is difficult there is a growing consciousness in India to deal with this issue. It would be wrong to feel that it is an India-specific problem, he noted.

While there is violence of this nature in the public domain, the violence within the private domain, within families is also a problem, Mr Singh said.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused of rape.
New Delhi:
A special fast track court has dismissed an application of Delhi Police seeking disposal of case property in the Uber cab rape case in which the driver has been sent behind bars for rest of his life.

The court rejected the police plea after Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, who was appointed by the State to try the case, submitted that the case property may not be disposed of as convict Shiv Kumar Yadav is likely to challenge the judgment before the Delhi High Court and these items including the Swift Dzire car in which the woman was raped may be required.

""Though, the case has been decided, public prosecutor submits that the case property may not be disposed of as the convict (Yadav) is likely to challenge the verdict and the case property may be required.

""In view of the submissions, the application stands dismissed. A copy of this order be sent to SHO Police Station Sarai Rohilla for information,"" Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja said.

The court had yesterday sentenced 33-year-old Yadav to imprisonment for his remaining life for raping and trying to strangulate the 26-year-old woman executive in his taxi 11 months ago, observing that his acts were ""against the society"" and should be dealt with an ""iron hand"".

The incident had taken place on the night of December 5 last year when the victim, a finance executive working in Gurgaon, was heading back to her house at Inderlok in Central Delhi.

Yadav was arrested on December 7, 2014 from Mathura and was in judicial custody since then.

The Uber cabbie, who raped and tried to strangulate a woman in his taxi in Delhi, did not think even once that his family would suffer greatly due to his act, a Delhi court today said while sentencing him to life imprisonment till his natural death.

Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja, while noting the ""helplessness"" of 33-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav's family members, directed Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA) to consider and make necessary provisions for their care and maintenance, besides providing adequate compensation to the girl.

""I am also conscious of the fact that the family of the convict, about whom he did not give a single though while committing the offence in question, would suffer greatly due to his acts,"" the judge said.

""Though monetary relief cannot be an adequate compensation for the helpless and innocent family members of the convict, yet having considered their plight in view of the offence committed by the convict and the sentence imposed upon him as a consequence thereof, I deem it appropriate to direct the DLSA to consider and make necessary provisions for care and maintenance of the old aged parents, wife and minor children of the convict,"" the judge said.

The court noted that Mr Yadav's family comprises his father, who is a retired teacher of a government school, his mother and wife, who are homemakers and three school-going children.

New Delhi:
An Uber cab driver held guilty of raping a passenger last year in an incident that sparked a nationwide debate on women's safety, has been sentenced to life in prison.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, had committed a ""very brutal crime"" and a strong message needs to go out, argued the prosecution in a special fast track court in Delhi today.

In a 99-page judgement last month, the court had said the 25-year-old woman was reminded of the horrific Delhi gang-rape in 2012 when the driver of the US-based service provider threatened to insert an iron rod in her body.

The court held that the threat was very real in the mind of the woman when the driver had threatened her.

Yadav was then found guilty of a series of charges including ""endangering a woman's life"".

Today, his wife and two daughters were present in court during the sentencing. His wife wept and fainted after the judge announced a life term. Yadav's lawyer had asked for a lighter sentence for him claiming that he was his family's only earner.

The woman, a financial executive working in Gurgaon near Delhi, has said that after she dozed off in the cab on the evening of December 5 last year, the driver took her to an unknown location, which later turned out to be a spot just a few kilometers from her home in west
Delhi.

Shiv Kumar Yadav was arrested two days later.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused of rape.
New Delhi:
The Uber cab driver, who was held guilty of raping a woman passenger in his taxi and trying to strangulate her while committing the act last year, is likely to be sentenced today by a Delhi court.

Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja, who had convicted 32-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav, is scheduled to hear arguments on quantum of sentence and pronounce the order today.

The court had on October 20 held Yadav guilty of offences under sections 376(2)(m)(while committing rape causes grievous bodily harm or disfigures or endangers life of a woman), 366 (abducting with an intent to compel her for marriage), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 323 (causing hurt) of the IPC.

The offence of endangering woman's life while raping her entails a minimum of 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a maximum of life term.

In its 99-page judgement, the special fast track court set up to deal with cases of sexual offences against women has said the girl was reminded of the horrific December 16, 2012 gangrape incident after the driver of the US-based service provider had threatened to insert an iron rod in her body.

The court has held that threat perception was very much real in the mind of the 25-year-old girl when the driver had intimated and threatened her that too at an isolated spot in the late hours of December 5, 2014 night.

According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of December 5 last year when the girl, a finance executive working in Gurgaon, was heading back to her house at Inderlok.

Accused driver Shiv Kumar Yadav was arrested on December 7, 2014 from Mathura and is currently in judicial custody.

Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, appointed for conducting proceedings in the case, has said he would demand maximum punishment of life imprisonment which under the relevant provision of the amended rape law means jail term till the convict's remaining natural life.

The Danish tourist was allegedly gang-raped in New Delhi in January last year. (Representational image)
New Delhi:
In the case of an alleged gang-rape of a 52-year-old Danish woman in Delhi last year, the prosecution told a Delhi court today that a forensic expert had matched the DNA profile of the accused persons to samples collected from the victim's clothes.

Deposing as a prosecution witness, D S Paliwal, a senior scientific assistant (Biology) at Forensic Science Laboratory, Delhi, told Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja that DNA profile of the nine accused persons matched with the DNA profile from clothes of the woman, a blanket and other articles.

He, however, denied the suggestion given by the defence counsel that he had prepared a forged and false report without examining the exhibits at the instance of the investigating officer or the investigating agency, i.e. the Delhi Police.

""It is wrong to suggest that I have prepared and examined the exhibits without following due process. It is wrong to suggest that I am deposing falsely,"" the witness said, adding that 60 parcels relating to the case were received at FSL Rohini for examination.

Mr Paliwal, in his examination-in-chief through Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, also deposed that he has seen the report prepared by Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Copenhagen in Denmark and he was of the opinion that there was similarity in both the reports.

""It is wrong to suggest that I have wrongly deposed that there are similarity in the reports prepared by me and report prepared at Copenhagen,"" he said.

The court has fixed November 21 for recording statements of other prosecution witnesses.

The police, in its charge sheet, has said that the nine accused, had allegedly robbed and gang-raped the Danish tourist at knife-point after leading her to a secluded spot close to the Divisional Railway Officers' Club near New Delhi Railway Station on the night of January 14 last year.

The accused were arrested which included three juveniles, who are facing an inquiry before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).

The six adult accused - Mahendra alias Ganja (24), Mohd Raja (22), Raju (23), Arjun (21), Raju Chakka (22) and Shyam Lal (55), are in judicial custody and facing trial.

The nine accused have been booked on charges of gang-rape and robbery, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt under IPC.

Earlier, depositions of the victim and two Danish police officers, who had come to Delhi from Denmark in pursuance to summons, were also recorded by the court.

During an in-camera hearing on July 1, the woman had narrated to the judge the entire incident and identified three of the six adult accused as the ones who had allegedly gang-raped her. However, while deposing before JJB, she had turned hostile and failed to identify the three minor offenders.

Delhi was the center of a nationwide protest following the rape and torture of a 23-year-old medical student in December 2012.
New Delhi:
On December 15, the juvenile found guilty in the 2012 Delhi gang rape, will be released. He has turned 21 and will complete his three-year term at the rehabilitation centre.

He was 17-and-a-half, the youngest of six men who raped and brutally tortured a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus in the capital on December 16, 2012. She died 13 days later in hospital.

Four other men found guilty in the case are on death row. One died in jail.

The 21-year-old is reportedly afraid of returning to his village in Uttar Pradesh. He fears for his life because of the gravity of the crime he committed.

He has been given professional counselling after he was allegedly radicalised by another boy lodged at the centre for the 2011 Delhi High Court blast that killed 15. Sources said the other juvenile, from Kashmir, was ""brainwashing"" him to join jihad.

Though he is an adult now, the law says the young man's name or identity cannot be revealed.

His release from the home comes as a debate is raging again on whether the age at which a person can be tried in court for a crime should be lowered to 16 from 18, after a two-and-a-half year child was brutally raped, allegedly by two minors in the capital.      

At the centre, superintendent Premoday Khakha says, ""I feel a person can be transformed at any age and we can't punish all minors harshly for a heinous crime committed by a few"".

Mr Khaka, who has for the last three years observed the young man accused of a crime that shook the conscience of a nation, says, ""The maximum number of boys found violating the law are those who come from deprived sections and those who have no support from family or society.""

NDTV learned that almost 20 per cent of the children lodged in juvenile centres have nowhere to go when they are released. They have either run away from home years ago or been abandoned by their families.

Her relatives approached police after she returned home and told her mother of her ordeal.
New Delhi:
A 15-year-old girl was allegedly raped in east Delhi's Pandav Nagar area with the accused in the case suspected to be a minor, police said today.

The accused, a resident of a slum cluster in Shashi Garden area, has been arrested by police, said an official.

According to police, the incident was reported yesterday evening when the girl was returning from a visit to the grocer's shop.

On her way back, scared by a pack of stray dogs, she tried to hide behind some bushes near a temple when the accused pulled the girl inside his shanty, police said. The shack was close to the spot where the girl was hiding, they added.

The boy, who was allegedly following the girl, took advantage of the situation to drag her inside his shanty and force himself upon her, said the official.

Her relatives approached police after she returned home and told her mother of her ordeal. She was subsequently taken for a medical examination, which confirmed rape, said the official.

Police registered a case and the accused was apprehended from his house immediately. Police said it was found that the accused is addicted to drugs and often created ruckus in his slum cluster.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused of rape.
New Delhi:
The woman who was raped by a Uber cab driver was reminded of the horrific December 16, 2012, gang-raped incident after the driver of the US-based service provider had threatened to insert an iron rod in her body and also tried to strangle her while committing the act, a Delhi court said.

The court held that threat perception was very much real in the mind of the 25-year-old woman when convict driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, had intimated and threatened her that too at an isolated spot in the late hours of December 5 last year.

The special fast track court set up to deal with cases of sexual offences against women said Yadav had endangered her life by forcefully pressing her neck while raping her.

""It must be borne in mind that when accused threatened the victim by saying that he will insert 'saria' (iron rod) inside her body, she was reminded of gang-rape case of December 16, 2012 and thus the threat perception was very much real in her mind at that point of time and offence under section 506 IPC thus stands duly proved against the accused,"" Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja said in the 99-page judgment.

""In view of the aforesaid evidence, there is thus no room for doubt that accused, by forcefully pressing the neck of the prosecutrix while committing rape upon her in the aforesaid manner, endangered her life and thereby committed offence punishable under section 376(2)(m) of IPC,"" the court said.

It rejected the contention of Yadav's counsel, Dharmendra Kumar Mishra, that the offence of criminal intimidation cannot be made out against the driver as he had not shown any rod to the victim while extending this threat.

While holding him guilty of offences, the court relied on the woman's testimony saying she was a ""reliable and truthful witness"" and despite lengthy cross-examination, her deposition remained ""unimpeached"".

The court observed that allegations against Yadav that he had attempted to commit unnatural sex with the woman was duly proved by the DNA and other scientific reports.

""To my mind the testimony of the prosecutrix that accused forcibly committed sexual intercourse with her and even attempted to do unnatural sex with her is completely fortified by the scientific evidence by way of DNA examination report,"" the judge said.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused of rape.
New Delhi:
A court in Delhi today fixed November 3 for hearing arguments on the sentencing of Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, who has been held guilty in a rape case.

Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja deferred arguments on the sentencing against Yadav after it was apprised by Tihar Jail officials that he could not be brought before court as security forces are busy with preparations for the India-Africa Summit here opening on October 26.

Yadav was convicted on Tuesday on charges of rape, causing grievous bodily harm and endangering the life of the woman, and other charges dealing with kidnapping, criminal intimidation and voluntarily causing hurt.

Police said the woman executive was raped by Yadav on the night of December 5, 2014, in the cab she hired to head back home in north Delhi's Inderlok area. Yadav drove the woman to an isolated place and raped her.

A Delhi court is likely to pronounce the order in Uber rape case after hearing arguments on quantum of sentence.
New Delhi:
A Delhi court is likely to pronounce its order tomorrow on the quantum of sentence in the Uber cab rape case in which the driver has been convicted of raping a 25-year-old woman executive in his taxi last year.

Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja, who was presiding the special fast track court set up to deal with cases of sexual offences against women, had on October 20 held 32-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav guilty of raping and endangering the victim's life in December last year.

Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, appointed for conducting proceedings in the case, had said he would demand maximum punishment of life imprisonment which under the relevant provision of the amended rape law means jail term till the convict's remaining natural life.

The court would pronounce the order after hearing arguments on quantum of sentence.

Yadav was held guilty for the offences under sections 376 (2)(m) (while committing rape causes grievous bodily harm or disfigures or endangers life of a woman), 366 (abducting with an intent to compel her for marriage), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 323 (causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.

According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of December 5, last year when the victim, a finance executive working in Gurgaon, was heading back to her house at Inderlok in north- west Delhi.

It had told the court that Yadav had slapped her several times and pressed her neck.

The prosecutor had said that as per the doctor, the scratch marks on the victim's neck were suggestive of an attempt to strangulate her.

After the court had convicted Yadav, the victim's father, who was present in the courtroom, expressed satisfaction that justice has been done to his daughter.

The driver's wife broke down outside the court room and said the family has been ruined.

Advocate DK Mishra, who is representing Yadav, had said he would challenge the verdict in the Delhi High Court.

The offence of endangering woman's life while raping her entails a minimum of 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a maximum of life term.

Yadav was arrested from Mathura on December 7, 2014, two days after the incident, is currently in judicial custody.

Yadav, however, has denied the allegations levelled against him terming them as false.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court today convicted an Uber cab driver for raping a young woman passenger last year, in a case that sparked massive outrage and reignited a debate on the safety of women in the national capital.

On December 5, Shiv Kumar Yadav had sexually assaulted the 25-year-old woman - a finance executive working in Gurgaon - in the cab she had hired to get home after dinner with her friends. Yadav was arrested two days later from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh.

The court today found Yadav guilty on all four charges - rape, abduction, intimidation and causing harm. The 32-year-old faces a maximum punishment of life sentence for the offences. The court will hear arguments on his sentencing on Friday, October 23.

""Shiv Kumar Yadav is convicted of all charges (framed against him). To come up for arguments on quantum of sentence on October 23,"" Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja said in a brief order.

Yadav, who was present in the court room, appeared distraught as the verdict was pronounced. He was immediately whisked away by cops and was taken to Tihar Jail where he has been lodged since his arrest last year.

According to the police, the woman fell asleep in the cab and was then taken to a deserted area not far from her home in north Delhi where Yadav raped her and threatened to violate her with an iron rod, a barbarous tactic used in the fatal gang-rape of a young student on a moving bus in the capital in 2013.

Yadav was tried by one of the special fast-track courts introduced in 2013 following the fatal gang-rape of the student, a crime that had shocked the nation and sparked unprecedented protests.

Uber was banned from operating in Delhi in the aftermath of the attack on the young woman executive.

The taxi-hailing app had drawn fire for failing to conduct adequate background checks after it emerged that Yadav had been accused of assaulting other women, although he had not been convicted in any of the cases.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court is likely to pronounce its judgment in last year's rape case of a 25-year-old finance executive allegedly by an Uber cab driver.

The incident took place on the night of December 5 last year when the victim, a finance executive working in Gurgaon, was heading back to her house at Inderlok.

The accused driver Shiv Kumar Yadav was arrested on December 7, 2014 from Mathura and is currently in judicial custody.

Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava had earlier said that an accused can be convicted on the basis of sole testimony of the victim if it is trustworthy.

But Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja had on October 7 reserved the verdict after concluding hearing final arguments from both the sides in the case.

He had said there was sufficient evidence on record to hold Yadav guilty in the case and none of the 28 prosecution witnesses has spoken contrary to the police case.

Advocate DK Mishra, appearing for Yadav, had argued that there were several contradictions in the prosecution's story and the alleged victim's version and false evidence was planted to implicate his client.

He had also argued that the woman had made various improvements in her statements before the court and police. The Supreme Court had earlier set aside the Delhi High Court order allowing the accused to re-examine 13 prosecution witnesses, including the victim.

The woman and the Delhi Police had moved the top court against the high court order. The proceedings in the case were stayed by the Supreme Court for six months from March 10 to September 10.

The trial court has framed charges against Yadav under the Indian Penal Code for alleged offences of endangering a woman's life while raping her, abducting with an intent to compel her for marriage and criminally intimidating and causing hurt.

The court had also recorded the testimony of the accused in which he termed the charge against him as ""false"".

New Delhi:
Delhi Police today suggested to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government to build up enough creches for working mothers and make value education compulsory in schools and colleges, in the wake of the two recent cases of rape with minors.

In his letter to Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, Police Commissioner BS Bassi said that the number of working women in the city should be assessed and creches (day-care homes) should be built for their children accordingly.

Referring to the incident in east Delhi's Anand Vihar, where a five-year-old girl, whose parents were out working, was allegedly raped by three men, the police commissioner said, there are thousands of such mothers - mostly the ones employed in the unorganised sector - who have to leave their children at homes in the absence of adequate day-care facilities.

""I also suggested that moral education and value education should immediately be introduced for boys in schools and colleges as compulsory subjects,"" Mr Bassi said, adding, schools should also look for ""deviant behaviour"" among children and provide for a ""system"" to ""ensure"" that they are corrected through counselling by psychologists.

The police chief further said that the government should also assess school dropouts and provide for their rehabilitation.

Mr Bassi sent the letter to Mr Sisodia this morning. Copies of the letter were also marked to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung.

Attributing the increase in the crime rate in Delhi to ""truthful registration"" of cases, the commissioner claimed that incidents of crime are ""not increasing"", it is the ""registration of crime which has increased"".

He added that police needs help of civil society and the state government to fight crime.

New Delhi:
Delhi Government today appointed a Group of Ministers (GoM) to examine whether the existing law can be amended to ensurse death penalty or life imprisonment to those involved in raping minors and to lower the cut off age of juveniles found guilty in such cases, besides to explore possibility of setting up special police stations.

The decision to appoint the Group of Ministers (GoM), which will finalise the report within 15 days, was taken at a Cabinet meeting presided by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to discuss the law and order situation in the wake of rape of two minors including a two-and-half-year-old child in the city.

Briefing reporters, Mr Kejriwal said a Commission of Inquiry will be set up withing a week to examine issues relating to women safety and that a list of rape cases pending in various courts in Delhi will be prepared to fast-track them.

""Since CrPC and IPC are subjects in concurrent list over which Delhi Government has executive powers, GoM will examine and submit a report on whether Delhi Government can set up special police stations to register and investigate crime against women in those cases where women do not get satisfactory response from local police stations,"" said Mr Kejriwal.

He said the GoM will submit a concrete proposal so that an amendment bill can be laid in next session of the Assembly.

The Chief Minister said Delhi government was ready to spend funds to set up new courts and improve existing infrastructure in this regard.

The GoM will also examine whether the investigating officer can be held accountable in case of delay in filing charge sheets relating to cases of sexual violence against women, he said.

The GoM will also suggest measures for expeditious delivery of justice.

The GoM will be headed by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

Attacking the police, the Chief Minister said law and order situation has deteriorated significantly and women do not feel secure in the city.

""There is no fear among those who commit such crimes. The sense of security is over,"" the Chief Minister said.

Mr Kejriwal has been targeting the Centre following rapes of a two-and-half-year-old child and another five-year-old girl in the capital on Friday.

Yesterday, Mr Kejriwal had a meeting with Lt Governor Najeeb Jung following which he stepped up attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying he will not let him sleep ""peacefully"" if ""jungle raj prevails"".

""We will not allow the Prime Minister to sleep peacefully if women in Delhi do not get proper safety and the present trend of rapes continues. That is guaranteed,"" he had said.

Mr Kejriwal has been maintaining that there was no control over Delhi Police and it was high time they be made accountable.

New Delhi:
Prosecuting boys above the age of 15 years in case of heinous crimes, death penalty or life term for accused in such cases, time-bound investigation and fast tracking of cases - these are the key plans of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to make Delhi safer for children.

The Chief Minister made the announcements after a cabinet meeting this morning - days after a spate of rapes where little girls were targeted left Delhi shocked.

Last week, two girls were raped within a span of 24 hours - one is a two-and-a-half year child and the other a five-year-old. Two boys, aged 17, were caught by the police in the first case.

The increasing number of heinous crimes where boys below the age of 18 were found to be involved, led to the controversial move by the government earlier this year to try them as adults.

In May, the Lok Sabha passed a bill to amend the Juvenile Justice Act, under which children who are aged 16 and above will be tried as adults in crimes like rape and murder.

Mr Kejriwal has suggested pushing down the age bar to 15. ""I don't think the bad people live only in Delhi, and that people living in Kolkata, New York, London or Varanasi are saints. It is just that the fear of law is not there in Delhi,"" he said.

""A group of ministers, led by Manish Sisodia (the deputy chief minister who is also handling the law portfolio) will consider recommendations,"" Mr Kejriwal said. ""The Cabinet will look into the recommendations and come up with a proposal within 15 days.""

In the wake of the rapes, Mr Kejriwal has renewed his demand of removing the police from under the control of the Union home ministry and placing it under the Delhi government. Yesterday, he met Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung to press for the demand.

To help fast track rape cases, the government is prepared to provide infrastructure and will consult the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court in this matter, the Chief Minister said. ""Since safety is in the concurrent list, can we set up special police stations for women,"" he added.

Mumbai:
Accusing Arvind Kejriwal of playing ""politics of convenience"", the Shiv Sena today said if the Delhi Chief Minister could deploy AAP workers to ensure Pakistani singer Ghulam Ali's security, what makes him depend on police to ensure safety of women in the capital.

The Sena's comments come in the backdrop of a two-and-half-year-old girl and another five-year-old allegedly brutally raped in the capital on Friday, barely a week after an alleged sexual assault of a minor, triggering widespread outrage.

Condemning the rapes, Mr Kejriwal had hit out at Delhi Police, saying it had ""completely failed"" to provide safety to the citizens, while urging PM Narendra Modi to ""either act himself"" or give AAP government the authority over law and order in the capital.

Mr Kejriwal also said that PM Modi is ""answerable"" if he wants police to be under Centre's control and requested him to meet Delhi's Lt Governor Najeeb Jung, who he said, was keener on ""interfering in the AAP government's work"".

""Half of (Arvind) Kejriwal's time is spent in fighting with the Centre and the LG. There are no signs to indicate that the situation will improve if Delhi Police is brought under his ambit,"" an editorial in Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' said today.

Slamming the Aam Aadmi Party government, it further said, ""The health department is under him (Mr Kejriwal), but, there was a dengue outbreak and many people lost their lives. How will a government that cannot stop mosquitoes, stop goondaism, rapists and terrorists?""

The Sena said that the Delhi chief minister's commitment to protect Pakistani nationals is only giving strength to the country's enemies.

""(Arvind) Kejriwal has offered to host Ghulam Ali's concert in Delhi. If hundreds of AAP volunteers can come out on the streets to provide protection to Pakistani artists, why can't they take responsibility of women as well?"" the BJP's ruling alliance partner in Maharashtra asked.

""AAP says they do not need police to give security to Pakistanis, then why do they need police to control the law and order situation and to stop rapists,"" it further said.

""They are fighting with the Centre to bring the police under their control. This is only politics of convenience. The people of Delhi are tired because for their (AAP) government, security of Pakistanis is more important than security of women,"" the Sena said.

Police have released CCTV footage of the two men on a bike who abducted a two-and-a-half-year-old girl but the bike is yet to be traced.
New Delhi:
Just a week after the horrific rape and torture of a four-year-old girl in Delhi, two more cases of young girls being raped have been reported from the capital. Both the girls have suffered severe injuries and are recovering in hospital.

In the first case, a two-and-a-half-year-old girl was raped allegedly by two men who abducted her on a motorbike from outside her house in west Delhi's Nangloi area on Friday. Neighbours later found her lying unconscious and bleeding profusely at a nearby park.

The girl's mother has claimed that her daughter was kidnapped while she was watching a 'ramlila' performance near her house. ""My girl was watching 'ramlila' when there was a power cut. That is when they kidnapped her,"" she said.

The girl has suffered severe damage to her private parts and has bite marks on her body, said Swati Maliwal, the chairperson of Delhi Commission for Women who visited her today.

""Woke up to two incidents of gangrape of a two-year-old year old and five-year-old. Bleeding not stopping for the two-and-a-falf year-old year old. On the way to Sanjay Gandhi Hospital (sic),"" she had posted on Twitter this morning.

No arrests have been made in the case so far. The police have released video footage from a security camera near the girl's house that shows two men with a child on a bike. The bike is yet to be traced.

The same day, a five-year-old was raped allegedly by three men in east Delhi's Anand Vihar area. The girl was reportedly alone at home when one of the accused, her neighbour, took her to his house and then allegedly raped her along with his friends.

""Her clothes were partially torn with blood stains all over them. Some locals saw her and she told them she was sexually assaulted,"" an officer from Anand Vihar police station told news agency AFP.

Tests later confirmed she had been subjected to multiple assaults, he said. All three accused have been arrested.

New Delhi:
A four-year-old raped in Delhi has sustained injuries reminiscent of the December 16, 2012, rape case, doctors have said. With extensive damages in her intestines and private parts, apart from bruises and bites all over her body, she will need a series of surgeries over six months to completely recover, they said.

The child -- who has undergone an emergency surgery and is out of danger -- said the men had even beaten her with stones and tried to throttle her, sources told NDTV.

The child - who is from a low income family - had been lured from outside her house with chowmein and Rs 10 on Friday, said her father -- a resident of northwest Delhi's Keshavpuram.  Within an hour, she had crawled back, bleeding and in terrible pain.

The girl's father also claimed the assault was planned.

""The man had taken her to a jungle nearby where another man was waiting and she was raped there,"" he said. ""They wanted to kill her but heard some woman approaching so ran away, leaving her bleeding profusely. She somehow managed to crawl back.""
The child has named her assailants, but they are yet to be traced, the police said. Also, officers said the case, which currently mentions rape, can also include attempt to murder now that the child is conscious and is giving details of the assault.

The chairperson of Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), Swati Maliwal, who visited the child at the hospital, also described her injuries as ""horrific"".
Visited the little girl, her condition cant be described. Horrific. Her parents are extremely poor. When will this heinous crime stop in Del

Joint Commissioner Bharti Arora has accused her boss, Commissioner Navdeep Singh Virk, of framing a family in a rape case and harassing her for pointing it out.
New Delhi:
Open warfare has started between two senior officers of the Haryana police. Joint Commissioner Bharti Arora has accused her boss, Commissioner Navdeep Singh Virk, of framing a family in a rape case and harassing her for pointing it out. She has complained to the Director General of Police YP Singhal, demanding a probe into the matter by the Central Bureau of Investigation.

Mr Virk, who has denied the charges, has accused Ms Arora of shielding the accused because of  ""vested interest"" in the case.

The case involves Ajay Bhardwaj, an executive with a multinational corporation and the son of Gurgaon's former deputy commissioner RP Bhardwaj. He has been accused of rape by his live-in partner, with whom he reportedly has two children.

Ms Arora said after she started investigation in August, she found Mr Bhardwaj had been falsely implicated and the woman had earlier accused two other men of rape.

But when the woman approached Mr Virk, he took up the case and after investigation, ordered the arrest of the whole family of Mr Bhardwaj. They have been charged with rape and criminal intimidation.

""I realised that the Commissioner of Police has falsely implicated an entire family in the case. I objected and told him this is wrong. Then he started torturing me mentally, threatened me and said, 'leave the case, otherwise you will suffer',"" Ms Arora told media.

She added that the Police chief has been spying on her.

""Now I'm being treated like a criminal -- all because I have raised my voice against injustice. I am an officer with a clean record, clear conscience and I fear none. Let CBI probe the case to find the truth.""

The open warfare, with the police actively approaching the media has raised questions about a rift within the force.

In Panchkula, state police chief Mr Singhal said he has received separate communications from both officers and the matter will be probed.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused of rape, had wanted to recall and re-examine witnesses in the case.
New Delhi:
Final arguments in the case of a woman executive's rape by an Uber cab driver resumed today in a court in New Delhi with the accused's submission claiming that the prosecution has planted a case against him.

Accused Shiv Kumar Yadav's counsel, Dharmender Mishra told Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja that Delhi Police has planted a false case against his client.

He told the court that police have not mentioned the sources from where the route maps of the cabs were generated in their document, while claiming the GPS route map was an artistic imaginary data sketched by the Delhi Police to implicate his client.

The counsel also claimed that Yadav was not with the woman when the alleged incident took place.

Final argument will continue on Saturday.

The argument was resumed after the Supreme Court set aside the Delhi High Court order permitting the recall and re-examination of 13 witnesses including the victim in the rape case.

According to police, the woman executive was allegedly raped by Yadav on the night of December 5, 2014, in the cab she hired to head back home in north Delhi's Inderlok area. The accused drove the woman to an isolated place and allegedly raped her.

The court had on January 13 framed charges of rape, causing grievous bodily harm and endangering the life of a woman, besides other, against Yadav under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused of rape, had wanted to recall and re-examine witnesses in the case.
New Delhi:
A court in New Delhi today fixed September 24 to hear final arguments in the case of rape of a woman executive by an Uber cab driver.

Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja listed the matter for September 24 for hearing final arguments in the case, as it did not receive the case file and other records from the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court has set aside the Delhi High Court order permitting the recall and re-examination of 13 witnesses including the victim in the Uber cab rape case.

According to police, the woman executive was allegedly raped by 32-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav on the night of December 5, 2014, in the cab she hired to head back home in north Delhi's Inderlok area. The accused drove the woman to an isolated place and allegedly raped her.

The three accused, including BJP legislator Umesh Aggarwal have pleaded not guilty to the charge of rape, the Delhi court fixed October 1 for recording of evidence.
New Delhi:
A Delhi court has put on trial a BJP legislator from Haryana and two others for allegedly raping a woman in a hotel after giving her sedative-laced drink, saying that a prima facie case has been made out against them.

The court framed charges against BJP legislator Umesh Aggarwal and Sandeep Luthra for alleged offences of rape, causing hurt by means of poison and criminal intimidation under provisions of the Indian Penal Code.

Additional Sessions Judge, Nivedita Anil Sharma also framed charges against one Rekha Suri, who was a friend of alleged victim and had taken her to a hotel in Faridabad, for alleged offences of abetment to rape. All the accused have denied the charges.

""It is prima facie clear that both accused Sandeep Luthra and Umesh Aggarwal have intoxicated, raped and threatened the prosecutrix and accused Rekha has abetted the commission of intoxication and rape by accused Umesh Aggarwal and Sandeep Luthra,"" the court said.

As per the police, on January 5, the woman had complained about the alleged incident that took place on January 3, when she had gone to a hotel in Faridabad at the insistence of her friend Rekha, on January 3. After sometime, Umesh, who had come to meet Rekha, gave her a drink. After consuming it, she became unconscious, she alleged, adding that she was raped thereafter.

Next morning, Umesh called one Sandeep, who also raped the woman, the victim alleged in the complaint, adding that Sandeep later dropped her at Tilak Nagar in West Delhi.

The court has also issued notice to Director of Forensic Science Laboratory with directions to ensure that the exhibits of the case were examined expeditiously and the report submitted on October 1.

With the three accused pleading not guilty and claiming trial, the court fixed October 1 for recording of evidence. They alleged that there was a monetary dispute between the woman and Rekha, due to which false allegations were made by her against all the three.

A Delhi Court gave 15 years jail term to a Delhi Police employee for raping and cheating a woman. (Thinkstock)
New Delhi:
A Delhi Police employee has been jailed for 15 years for raping and cheating a woman by concealing his first marriage, by a court which said that sentence for ""outrageous crimes like rape and bigamy"" must be a deterrent for others.

""The crimes of rape and bigamy are the most-hated crimes in the society. Society wants and expects perpetrators of such crimes to be punished very sternly.... The punishment for these offences should be deterrent to the extent that no other member of society dares to engage in such crimes....,"" Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhatt said.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs three lakh on convict Ravi Rathi, who had developed intimacy with the victim in a police training college whom he had met in 2009.

After two years of courtship, he secretly married the victim in October 2013. Later, it was found that Mr Rathi had already married another woman in May the same year he married the victim.

""The convict has not only ruined the entire life of the prosecutrix but also has deceived and cheated upon his first wife. He has played with the emotions and sentiments of the two women. He does not appear to have any concern and respect for women and the marriage vows,"" the court said.

It also said the convict seemed to be a ""sex maniac"" and did not deserve to be let off lightly.

""To him (convict) it appears that women are only objects for sex gratification and the marriage is a mere joke. He seems to be a sex maniac and does not deserve to be let off lightly. He deserves an exemplary sentence,"" the court said.

The court sentenced Mr Rathi to jail, while holding him guilty of the offences under sections 376 (rape), 495 (bigamy with concealment of former marriage from person with whom subsequent marriage is contracted), 417 (cheating) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of Indian Penal Code.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused of rape, had wanted to recall and re-examine witnesses in the case.
New Delhi:
The Supreme Court has set aside a Delhi High Court order that allowed rape-accused Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav to recall and re-examine prosecution witness in the Uber rape case. Yadav had wanted to recall 13 witnesses, including the young woman executive who had alleged rape.

The Supreme Court had stayed the Delhi High Court order in March, after a plea by the woman and Delhi Police. The woman had argued that recalling and re-examining witnesses would amount to a retrial.

The court had also restrained media from reporting statements of witnesses which were recorded after the High Court's order.

The order was set aside today by a two-judge bench comprising Justices JS Khehar and Adarsh Kumar Goel. In an earlier hearing, the Supreme Court had said that Yadav was trying to ""destroy criminal justice system"" by seeking re-examination of the woman, who has only been ""embarrassed and insulted"" by him in her earlier deposition.

The top court also questioned Yadav's intention in seeking a recall of witnesses, saying the process had only delayed the trial by several months and led to harassment of the woman. It had further observed that Yadav had ""misused"" the process of law in doing this.

The trial is for an incident that allegedly took place in Delhi on the night of December 5, 2014. The woman, an executive for a finance firm in Gurgaon, had alleged that the driver had raped her.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court has awarded 10-year jail terms to four people - earlier convicted for the brutal gang rape of Nirbhaya on December 16, 2012 - in a robbery case that occurred the same night.

Additional Sessions Judge Reetesh Singh on August 27 convicted the four for robbery, kidnapping, wrongfully confining a person, voluntarily causing hurt in committing or attempting to commit robbery, dishonestly receiving stolen property knowing it was obtained by robbery and common intention under the Indian Penal Code.

The four gang-rape convicts - Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Mukesh and Pawan Gupta - were tried for beating up and robbing carpenter Ram Adhar, before they raped and brutally assaulted a 23-year-old physiotherapist in a moving bus in Delhi on December 16, 2012.

All four were sentenced to death in the gang rape case by a trial court, which was confirmed by the Delhi High Court. The matter is now pending in the Supreme Court.

The Delhi Police, in its charge sheet filed on March 15, 2013, in the robbery case, said bus driver Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh, Vinay, Pawan and Akshay, along with a juvenile, snatched Ram Adhar's mobile phone and Rs.1,500 after luring him into the bus.

Mukesh, Vinay, Pawan and Akshay were put on trial in this case in which charges were framed in July 2013. Charges against Ram Singh abated after his death in Tihar Jail in March 2013.

SAN FRANCISCO:
A woman who had accused a cab driver of raping her in Delhi in December last year, which sparked countrywide debate on women safety, has voluntarily withdrawn the case she had filed against the app-based cab service Uber in the US, according to a court on Tuesday.

The woman, who works for a finance company in Gurgaon, had accused the driver of raping and beating her after she had boarded the cab in Delhi. The driver was arrested within a week of the complaint and was charged with various sections under the Indian Penal Code. The Delhi High Court is hearing the case against the driver.

The woman had sued the company in a federal court in the US in January, claiming the company failed to maintain basic safety procedures. Uber's Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick at the time called the incident ""horrific"" and pledged to help ""bring this perpetrator to justice."" However, during the case, Uber also argued that the woman sued the wrong corporate entity as the driver had a contract with Uber B V, a Netherlands-based entity with no US operations.

The court filing did not disclose any details on how the case was settled, and representatives for Uber and the woman declined to comment.

India is one of Uber's largest markets outside the United States by the number of cities covered. The company valued at around $50 billion this year, has said it would introduce additional safety measures including more stringent driver checks and an in-app emergency button.

In the lawsuit, the woman, who was not named, had called Uber the ""modern day equivalent of electronic hitchhiking."" ""Buyer beware - we all know how those horror movies end,"" the lawsuit stated.

Earlier this year, both sides had agreed to participate in private mediation to try to resolve the lawsuit, according to court filings.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court has granted liberty to a man to sue a woman for damages on account of frame-up after acquitting him of the charge of raping her and observing that he suffered humiliation and trauma besides the expenses of litigation.

The court said the man's plight may continue as his implication may have caused an uproar in the society but his acquittal may not even be noticed.

""It cannot be ignored that the accused, due to this case which has ultimately ended in his acquittal, may have suffered humiliation, trauma, distress and misery besides the expenses of the litigation...

""He will continue to suffer the stigma of being a rape case accused. It may not be possible to restore his dignity and honour nor compensate him for the humiliation, misery, distress and monetary loss. However, his acquittal may give him some solace. He may also file any case for damages against the prosecutrix, if advised,"" Additional Sessions Judge Nivedita Anil Sharma said.

The court's observations came while acquitting a resident of Mukherjee Nagar in New Delhi of the charge of repeatedly raping and criminally intimidating a woman who was working in his organisation on the false promise of marriage.

It freed the man after the woman turned hostile and said that she was not raped by him and physical relations between them were consensual.

The woman lodged an FIR at Hari Nagar Police Station here alleging that in February 2013, the man gave her a cold drink laced with sedatives and thereafter, raped her.

She alleged that the man continued to raped her at several places from February to August 2013, on the false promise to marry her and threatened to publish her obscene videos.

The woman, however, turned hostile and changed her statement in the court deposing that the physical relations between her and the man were with her consent. She said she had lodged the complaint at the instance of some well-wishers and sought acquittal of the man saying he had not done anything wrong with her.

""... I am of the considered view that the case of the prosecution cannot be treated as trustworthy and reliable as the prosecutrix has retracted and resiled from her earlier statement,"" the judge said.

The court said, ""There was no material on record to show that the man had intoxicated the woman, raped, beaten her, prepared her obscene videos, threatened to publish her video and raped her under the false promise to marry.""

New Delhi:
One of the four men sentenced to death for the horrific rape and murder of a student in a moving bus in Delhi in December 2012, has alleged that he has been beaten up by other inmates at the Tihar Jail.

Vinay Sharma -- who claimed his left arm had been fractured in the attack on August 15 -- has moved court demanding security. His counsel has moved an application in court, which will hear the matter on Tuesday.

Sources in Tihar said Vinay had been engaged in a brawl with three other convicts but he had suffered no fracture. An internal report on the matter is being prepared.

Six men - one of them a juvenile - had initially been convicted in the Nirbhaya case.

In March 2013, one of the accused, Ram Singh -- who had allegedly been driving the bus which the woman and her male friend had been lured into and inside which the crime had taken place -- was found hanging in Tihar jail.

The authorities said he had committed suicide. But his family and lawyers had contended that he had been murdered.

The surviving four are lodged in high-security cells at the Tihar Jail, while their appeals against the death sentence are being heard by a court.

The torture and subsequent death of the 23-year-old para-medical student -- who was on way home on a winter evening after watching a movie at a south Delhi multiplex -- had shocked the country. Protests had been held across Delhi and other metros.

The juvenile, who had been a few months short of 18 when the crime was committed, had been given detention for three years -- which sparked furore and triggered moves to change the Juvenile Justice Act.

Fresh outrage had started last year when one of the convicts in the case, Mukesh Singh, made certain comments in a documentary that showed a marked lack of remorse.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court today continued with the recording of a police sub-inspector's statement in connection with the case of alleged rape of a 52-year-old Danish woman by nine persons in Delhi last year.

Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja recorded the testimony of prosecution witness, Sub Inspector Anand, in the case.

Recording of his statement, however, remained inconclusive and would continue on August 11.

The court had yesterday also recorded his statement along with that of two constables.

Earlier, depositions of the woman and two Danish police officers who had come to Delhi from Denmark in pursuance to summons were also recorded by the court.

In an in-camera hearing on July 1, the woman had narrated to the judge the entire incident of January 14, 2014 and identified three of the six adult accused as the ones who had gangraped her.

The police, in its charge sheet, had said that the nine accused, all vagabonds, had allegedly robbed and gangraped the Danish tourist at knife-point on that night after leading her to a secluded spot close to the Divisional Railway Officers' Club near New Delhi Railway Station.

The nine accused, including three juveniles, were arrested. The three juveniles are facing an inquiry before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) in Delhi.

The six adult accused - Mahendra alias Ganja (24), Mohd Raja (22), Raju (23), Arjun (21), Raju Chakka (22) and Shyam Lal (55), are in judicial custody and facing trial.

The nine accused have been booked for the alleged offences of gangrape and robbery or dacoity, with an attempt to cause death or grievous hurt of the IPC.

The woman had also deposed before JJB where she turned hostile and failed to identify the three minor offenders, saying she had not seen them before.

She had narrated the entire incident to the JJB presiding officer and identified her robbed articles, including her hand purse, which were recovered from the possession of the accused.

A Delhi court has recorded statements of three policemen in a case of alleged rape of a 52-year-old Danish woman in Delhi last year.

Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja recorded their testimonies as prosecution witnesses in the case. The court recorded the depositions of sub-inspector Anand who had made the first arrest in the case by nabbing accused Mahender, and constables Dharam Pal and Vijay Pal who had taken the accused to hospital for their medical examination after their arrests.

Recording of Anand's statement remained inconclusive and his deposition will continue on Wednesday. Their examination-in-chief was recorded through Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava.

The non-profit had been at the centre of the fresh controversy after a former employee posted the accusation of sexual assault on Facebook.
New Delhi:
Greenpeace India has apologized unconditionally for mishandling in cases of alleged rape and sexual harassment of its staffers. The organisation also said that its delay in response was probed by the Greenpeace International, its global head office based in Amsterdam.

The non-profit -- which had been facing trouble over the government bar on its funding from abroad - had been at the centre of the fresh controversy after a former employee posted the accusation of sexual assault on Facebook.

Admitting that ""over the past three years a number of complaints of sexual harassment were made by women who worked for Greenpeace India,"" the organization said it was ""profoundly disturbed"" that Greenpeace could be ""this kind of place"".

It said it was ""equally disturbed by the inexcusable failures to handle these complaints"". ""We apologise to our colleagues, our apology is unconditional,"" the statement added.

In the Facebook post, the woman had alleged that she had to leave her job in 2013 after being sexually harassed and raped by a colleague. The man, she wrote, was a serial offender. Her written complaint to the HR regarding instances of molestation, made in 2012, had elicited no response. The next year, she was raped at a party, she said.

""There are no words that can fully express the regret that we feel, and no excuses for the decisions made,"" the statement by Greenpeace read. The men allegedly involved have been ""told to clear their desks and not return,"" it added.

""But it took too long for that to happen,"" Greenpeace said. ""The response by Greenpeace India to the complaints made by our colleagues fell far short of what it should have been. Very far short.""

The independent review by the organisation's head office found that the HR manager had failed to declare the earlier cases -- reported in December 2012 -- as sexual harassment. ""This failing was a major contributor to the subsequent breakdown of trust and the failure to achieve satisfactory closure to the cases,"" the report said.

The woman has refused to approach the police despite requests from Greenpeace.

Activists have held that the two-finger vaginal examination is traumatic for the rape survivor and helps the perpetrator get away. (Representational Image)
New Delhi:
The Delhi Government today said that its circular on the two-finger test - a vaginal test for rape survivors -- that generated much controversy, had been ""misinterpreted"". Health Minister Saytendra Jain said the government would prefer to clarify that the test was ""banned for sexual assault victims"".
""It is advised that medical professionals should nor perform the finger test unless it is medically indicated for only treatment purpose,"" Mr Jain told reporters.
The circular was sent out on May 31 by the Health and Family Welfare Department.
The Union government had banned the test last year, after the Supreme Court held in 2013 that it violates a woman's right to privacy, and asked the government to provide better medical procedures to confirm sexual assault.

In the so-called ""two-finger test"", doctors probe the vagina to determine if a hymen is present and to try to determine if the vagina is lax, which is taken as evidence that the woman routinely has sex and thus consented to intercourse. Often, the doctor is male.

Activists and lawyers have for long criticised the test as unscientific and unnecessary and one that subjects the complainant to further trauma and humiliation and often allows a rapist to get away.

The test was banned by the Department of Health Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research in a new set of guidelines issued in 2014.

In January 2013, the Justice Verma committee - set up to frame stricter anti-rape laws after the brutal gang-rape and murder of a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi - had criticised the two-finger vaginal examination.

New Delhi:
In a change from the trend of the last several years, the graph of heinous crimes in Delhi has come down a bit with the number of cases of rape, murder and dacoity registering a fall in the first four months of this year as compared to the corresponding period last year.

According to data available with Delhi Police, the city witnessed 621 rapes till April 30 this year, which was marginally less than last year's figure of 640 during the first four months.

When it comes to murders, which is considered the yardstick of crime in a city, police registered 165 cases under section 302 IPC in this period this year as against 184 in the corresponding period.

Till April 30 this year, 26 cases of dacoity were registered with Delhi Police as compared to 34 in the same period last year. Cases of hurt also went down from 619 in 2014 to 576 this year.

However, cases of molestation of women continued to rise from 1,255 in the first four months of last year to 1,474 in corresponding period this year.

Similar upward trend has been witnessed in cases of motor vehicle theft, which grew from 6,519 in 2014 to 9,112 year in the first four months of this year. Burglary cases rose from 3,037 to 4,203 in 2015 while cases of robbery registered a quantum jump from 1,537 last year to 2,218 this year.

Cases of attempt to murder registered a marginal hike from 209 in 2014 to 225 this year. Snatching cases climbed from 2,587 last year to 3,087 in 2015.

If one looks at the statistics of the last two years, every crime head had registered a steady increase. In 2014, 2,166 rape cases were reported as compared to 1,636 cases in 2013. 4,322 cases of molestation of women were reported in 2014 while in 2013 the number stood at 3,515.

In 2014, cases of murder in the national capital grew from 517 to 586 while cases of dacoity more than doubled with 33 in 2013 to 82 in 2014. Cases of robbery grew exponentially from 1,245 in 2013 to 6,464 in 2014.

""After the December 16, 2012 incident, the society was forced to think in this direction and steps were taken. Women got a new self confidence as law was changed; police was sensitized. This caused a spurt of 300 to 400 per cent rise in crimes against women in 2013. The trend continued in 2014 although it was not that steep,"" Delhi Police Commissioner B S Bassi had recently said.

""Now, if we see those figures in continuation in 2015, we find that they are almost similar, even lower,"" he added.

New Delhi:
A bill that will allow children who are 16 and above to be tried as adults in serious crimes like rape and murder is a step closer to becoming law with the Lok Sabha passing it today. All parties voted unanimously in favour of the bill.

The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill 2014, which will next be taken up in the Rajya Sabha, says that whether an accused between 16 and 18 years should be tried as an adult will be decided by a Juvenile Justice Board.

""I don't want the children to be arrested, and no mother would want it. When I became minister there was a group of children committing crime and police officials worried over the matter, poverty cannot be used as an excuse to commit such crimes,"" Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi said.

The amended bill, she explained, seeks to streamline adoption procedures for orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children, and offers rehabilitation for children who need it. It clearly defines offences as petty, serious and heinous.

During the debate in the Lok Sabha, former Union minister Shashi Tharoor was among the members who voiced concerns, deviating from his Congress party's line.

""A majority of children in conflict with law come from illiterate and poor families. These are the ones you are trying to punish instead of giving them education,"" said the Congress MP, adding that the changes would only embarrass the government as they violate international laws that require a child accused of an offence to be treated differently from an adult.

Changes to the 2000 law were spurred by anger after the youngest convict in the 2012 gang-rape was tried in a juvenile court and sentenced to three years in a reform home. The convict was just a few months short of 18 when he and five others assaulted a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern on a moving bus, gang-raped her and tortured her with an iron rod.

The lighter punishment sparked a debate on whether India is soft on young offenders.

New Delhi:
International fugitive Raminder Singh, accused of raping a woman and attempting to sexually assault another in Scotland in 2012, has been arrested in Delhi, police said today.

""Raminder Singh was arrested yesterday (Sunday) from Delhi. He was staying in Chandigarh under a fake identity,"" Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Ravindra Yadav told IANS.

Acting on a tip, police nabbed 28-year-old Raminder Singh from Alipur in west Delhi, when he reached there from Punjab to meet one of his acquaintances for procuring a fake passport for himself.

Raminder Singh was accused of grievously injuring and attempting to rape a 23-year-old woman in Edinburgh, Scotland, on July 22, 2012 and raping another 27-year-old woman.

Immediately after the incident, he fled from Edinburgh and boarded a flight in Glasgow to New Delhi via Dubai on July 23, 2012. He arrived in New Delhi the next day and went into hiding.

A red corner notice was issued by Interpol on the day he disappeared and British authorities raised his extradition request with the Indian government.

Police received information that Raminder Singh was regularly shifting his base in Delhi, Punjab and Chandigarh.

He had assumed a fake identity and went by the name 'Jasdeep Singh Bajwa'. He also ran a restaurant Noor Mehal in Jalandhar.

Raminder Singh also lived for sometime with a relative, Assistant Sub-Inspector Gurwinder Singh, who works as an instructor at the Punjab Police Academy in Phillaur in Jalandhar district.

Raminder Singh was born in Chandigarh and went to Britain in 2009 to study for a diploma in hospitality. After his education, he worked as a bouncer in a club in Edinburgh.

File photo of BJP leader Kiran Bedi.
Washington:
Former top cop and BJP leader Kiran Bedi has said that the controversial BBC documentary on the Delhi gang rape case need not have been banned by the government without watching and analysing it, as it meets the ""needs of crime prevention strategies"" in chauvinistic segments of Indian society.

The documentary, ""India's Daughter"", about the infamous 2012 Delhi gang rape, premiered in the US this week but has been banned by the Indian government.
Ms Bedi told PTI in an interview, that the film is ""very strongly reflective of a prevailing mindset, which is rampant in our country, both in urban and rural settings"".

Currently in the US on a speaking tour, Ms Bedi, who has seen the documentary, said the film ""meets the need for a holistic crime prevention approach, particularly crimes against women"".

The male mindset of certain segments of society continues to be parochial, she said, adding that they feel that the ""space of women has to be restricted"", and that women are supposed to be ""subordinate"" to the male needs.

""While you have many progressive men in India today, there is a very large percentage of men who are controlling the lives of women,"" Ms Bedi said.

""I see this every day while working with families through my voluntary work. For me this film is very comprehensive evidence of all that India needs to address in this regard. Number one: this prevailing medieval male mindset. And secondly, sluggish criminal justice system,"" she said.

""For instance, this case is pending before the highest court for close to a year after being fast-tracked. Third is the apathetic community response in several cases of crimes against women,"" she argued.

The film, she noted, provides evidence of community indifference, weaknesses of justice system, ill equipped enforcement mechanisms, and of outdated mindset.

""From my perspective, this film could have been used as a catalyst for a much needed social revolution in India both for administrative learning as well as addressing the attitudes to ask people - how many of you are still like that?"" Kiran Bedi said.

""Hiding (banning the movie) is not the answer. Confronting the stark reality is the answer,"" she said.

""Yes,"" she said when asked if she believed that it is wrong of the Indian government to ban the film.

An important court ruling sets the stage for trial to begin after 10 years in Ashiana rape case
New Delhi:
At 13, she was kidnapped, gang-raped and tortured with lit cigarettes. Ten years on, trial will finally begin in the case after a court today rejected an appeal by the man who, along with five others, allegedly sexually assaulted her in Lucknow.

Accepting the juvenile board's decision, a fast-track court today ruled that Gaurav Shukla, the main accused, was not a minor when the crime was committed, which means he will be tried as an adult. But the accused plans to challenge the verdict in a higher court.

Gaurav has remained free all these years and is married. Activist Madhu Garg of AIDWA describes the girl's long and lonely battle for justice. ""She was traumatised after the incident, had nightmares and became withdrawn. She dropped out of school due to fear; in fact she had to be accompanied to public places. It was only after a long time that she regained some confidence,"" said Ms Garg.

After years of delay, the case was transferred to a special fast track court set up under new stronger laws enacted after the 2012 Delhi gang-rape.

""I have fought for ten years and will continue to fight until I get justice,"" the survivor, now 23, said.

Two accused have died; two others were sentenced for 10 years and the third was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Months after the incident, which came to be known as the ""Ashiana rape case"" because of the neighbourhood where the girl lived, the juvenile board declared Gaurav Shukla a minor based on his claim in a separate case.

In 2006, a woman's organization raised funds to hire a lawyer for the survivor, who then challenged Gaurav's claim.

Jalaj Gupta, the lawyer for the rape survivor, said in court that Gaurav used forged school documents to hide his age and his birth certificate proved that he was 18 at the time of the incident.

This case dragged on for four years and in 2010, the court rejected the juvenile board's order.

It took the juvenile board another three years to decide on Gaurav's age and when it did, he challenged the ruling.

A court is likely to give its verdict on the gang-rape of a woman 10 years ago, when she was 13
Lucknow:
At 13, she was kidnapped, gang-raped and tortured with lit cigarettes. Ten years on, a court will decide today on the appeal of the man who, along with five others, allegedly sexually assaulted her inside a moving car in Lucknow.

A fast-track court in Lucknow will decide on main accused Gaurav Shukla's petition against a juvenile board that has twice declared that he was above 18 when the crime was committed, which means he would be tried and punished as an adult.

Gaurav, the nephew of former Samajwadi Party lawmaker Arun Shukla, has remained free all these years and is married.

The rape trial is yet to start. After years of delay, the case was transferred to a special fast track court set up under new stronger laws enacted after the 2012 Delhi gang-rape.

""I have had to suffer culturally, socially and physically. The court case has gone on endlessly. The day I get justice will be the beginning of a new life,"" the survivor, now 23, has said.

Two accused have died; two others were sentenced for 10 years and the third was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Months after the incident, which came to be known as the ""Ashiana rape case"" because of the neighbourhood where the girl was found, the juvenile board declared Gaurav Shukla a minor based on his claim in a separate case.

In 2006, a woman's organization raised funds to hire a lawyer for the survivor, who then challenged Gaurav's claim.

Jalaj Gupta, the lawyer for the rape survivor, said in court that Gaurav used forged school documents to hide his age and his birth certificate proved that he was 18 at the time of the incident.

This case dragged on for four years and in 2010, the court rejected the juvenile board's order.

It took the juvenile board another three years to decide on Gaurav's age.

Between 2013 and 2014, the board declared twice that Gaurav was not a juvenile at the time of the rape. Both times, he challenged the order.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court today stayed a Delhi High Court order allowing the rape-accused Uber taxi driver to recall and re-examine 13 witnesses in the trial. The witnesses in question include the victim, a 25-year-old woman executive, who had been raped in a taxi in December 2014.

The top court also stayed the trial court proceedings, and restrained the media from reporting the statements of witnesses which have been recorded after the High Court's order.

""Issue notice to the respondents. The proceedings before the trial court shall remain stayed. The High Court order, dated March 4, shall also remain stayed,"" a bench headed by Justice J S Kehar said.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the alleged rape victim, said that the accused has wrongly been allowed to recall and re-examine the witnesses, and that this would create further agony for the victim and as a consequence, will delay the trial.

At the outset, the bench wanted to know whether the recalling of witnesses can be allowed at the instance of an accused or not.

It also said that to ensure fair trial, the accused may be allowed to re-examine the witnesses.

During the hearing, the bench drew a parallel with the grant and cancellation of bail to an accused with the permission to allow and disallow recalling of witnesses.

""Courts apply different yardsticks while granting and cancelling the bail. Likewise, if a court below has granted liberty to an accused to recall witnesses, then can this court deny it?"" the bench said.

Mr Gonsalves, however, said that the trial court had passed a ""well-reasoned order"" and while reversing that order the Delhi High Court didn't give any specific reason for it.

The top court had yesterday agreed to hear plea of the woman, who was allegedly raped by Shiv Kumar Yadav, driver of an Uber cab, after she said that recalling of witnesses amounted to retrial in the case and sought an urgent hearing on the matter.

On March 4, the Delhi High Court had allowed recall of 13 prosecution witnesses, including the victim in the case, on the plea of Yadav and said their cross examination will be carried out on a day-to-day basis.

The High Court had also made clear ""not to repeat any question which has already been put to the witnesses in their cross examination by the earlier counsel"".

It had said that in case any witness is not available for the purpose of further cross examination, his/her testimony shall be read in evidence as it is.

As per the charge sheet filed by Delhi Police, the incident took place on the night of  December 5 last year, when the victim, who was working for a finance company in Gurgaon, was headed back home.

She had taken the taxi from Vasant Vihar to go to her house in Inderlok and the accused after taking another route, raped her, police said.

Earlier, the trial court had rejected Yadav's plea for recalling witnesses while saying there was no change in circumstances except for a change of counsel, which was no ground to allow the application.

The trial in the case had commenced on January 15 and the prosecution had concluded recording its evidence in 17 days by examining 28 witnesses. The accused had not examined any witness in his defence.

The court on January 13 had framed charges against Yadav under various sections of the IPC for alleged offences of endangering a woman's life while raping her, kidnapping with intent to compel her for marriage, criminally intimidating and causing hurt.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court today agreed to hear tomorrow the plea of 25-year-old woman, who was allegedly raped by driver of a Uber cab in New Delhi, against the Delhi High Court order allowing the accused to recall and examine 13 witnesses including the victim in the trial.

""It will come tomorrow for hearing. In the meantime, correct all the defects,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice HL Dattu said.

Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the victim, said that Delhi High Court order amounts to re-trial of the case and sought urgent hearing of her plea.

On March 4, the Delhi High Court had allowed recall of 13 prosecution witnesses, including the victim in Uber cab rape case, on the plea of the accused driver and said their cross examination will be carried out on a day-to-day basis.

The high court had partly allowed the plea of accused Shiv Kumar Yadav while making it clear ""not to repeat any question which has already been put to the witnesses in their cross examination by the earlier counsel"".

Apart from the victim, the court had also allowed recall of investigating officers as well as some doctors who had examined the victim and the accused.

It had also said that in case any witness is not available for the purpose of further cross examination,his/her testimony shall be read in evidence as it is.

The victim is now being re-examined in-camera by the counsel for Yadav in the trial court.

As per the charge sheet filed by Delhi Police, the incident took place on the night of December 5 last year when the victim, who was working for a finance company in Gurgaon, was headed back home.

She had taken the taxi from Vasant Vihar to go to her house in Inderlok and the accused after taking another route, raped her, police said.

Earlier, the trial court had rejected Yadav's plea for recalling witnesses while saying there was no change in circumstances except for a change of counsel, which was no ground to allow the application.

'Have Re-Lived the Vicious Attack Multiple Times', Says Uber Rape Survivor on Women's Day

New Delhi:
It has been three months since a 25-year-old financial executive was raped in Delhi, allegedly by a driver of app-based taxi service Uber, but during this time, she has had to ""re-live the vicious attack multiple times.""

""While I would like to forget what happened to me when I was raped by an Uber driver back in December, I have had to re-live the vicious attack multiple times, most recently last week when I was cross examined for the second time by the assailant's counsel,"" the rape survivor says.

On International Women's Day today, the woman and her lawyer, have issued a statement, in which they say it is a day to reflect on ""how much more must be achieved before we can claim true equality.""

The young woman was sexually assaulted on December 8, allegedly by Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, who she had called by using the cab service's app. After much outrage over the incident, the transport department in Delhi had banned the use of Uber in the national capital.

But the victim, in her statement, points out how Uber has defied the ban in Delhi and is still operating without legal sanctions. She also claims that ""they have refused to meet with my legal team and me to discuss important safety measures that I believe are necessary to ensure that other women do not have to go through what I have endured.""

Cab service app Uber, with which Shiv Kumar Yadav had been registered, had drawn fire for failing to deliver on its promise of safety. Uber had not conducted any background checks on Yadav, who had at least five cases against him - two under the Uttar Pradesh Control of Goondas Act and the rest relating to sexual assaults.

Trial in the case had almost reached the final stage of arguments. But recently, the Delhi High Court granted a plea made by the accused, and passed orders to recall some witnesses. And the first person to be re-examined post that order was the rape survivor herself. The accused had appealed, as according to him, his previous defence counsel was incompetent.

Police teams associated with the case allege that the defence counsels have been delaying proceedings, despite filing chargesheet within 17 days of the incident and the prosecution examining all witnesses by the end of January.

The rape survivor has also filed a case in New York, to sue Uber, which is headquartered in San Francisco.

The Delhi gang-rape case provoked national outrage and led to massive protests across India.
United Nations:
The remarks by one of the Delhi gangrape convict blaming the victim for the assault are ""unspeakable"", UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon's spokesperson has said, stressing the need for men to get involved in halting violence against women.

Mr Ban's spokesperson Stephane Dujarric refused to further comment on the remarks made by Mukesh Singh, the driver of the bus in which the 23-year-old paramedical student was brutally gang-raped by six men on December 16, 2012.

""I'm not going to comment on the unspeakable comments that were made by the person accused of raping this girl, but I think the Secretary-General has spoken very clearly on the need to halt violence against women and on the need for men to get involved in halting violence against women and decrying it loud and clear every time it occurs,"" Stephane Dujarric told reporters.

In an interview for a BBC documentary on the rape of the girl, Singh appeared unrepentant for the abhorrent crime.

Amid wide public outrage over Singh's controversial remarks, the Indian government has banned the documentary on the 2012 gang rape 'India's Daughter'.

The government has secured a court injunction to stop the airing of the documentary across all media platforms in India.

When asked to comment on the Indian government's decision to not air the documentary and freedom of the press, Mr Dujarric refused to make any comments.

""I'm not going to get into it. Our position on freedom of the press is clear. Some countries have different rules regarding the viewing of evidence during judicial proceedings. I'm not aware of the full details of it, so I'll leave it at that,"" he said yesterday.

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court today allowed recall of 13 prosecution witnesses, including the victim in Uber cab rape case, on the plea of the accused driver and said their cross examination will be carried out on a day-to-day basis.

Justice Sunita Gupta partly allowed the plea of accused Shiv Kumar Yadav, who had allegedly raped the 25-year-old woman executive in December last year, while making it clear ""not to repeat any question which has already been put to the witnesses in their cross examination by the earlier counsel"".

Apart from the victim, the court also allowed recall of the investigating officers as well as some of the doctors who had examined the victim as well as the accused, saying it was necessary for ""ensuring a fair trial"".

"".... in view of the circumstances narrated by counsel for the petitioner, for ensuring fair trial, it is deemed proper to recall certain witnesses. That being so, in the interest of justice, the petition is partly allowed. Prosecution witnesses no. 2, 3, 4, 9, 12, 13, 14, 16, 20, 22, 24, 26, 27 be recalled for the purpose of further cross examination.

""Needless to say, it is impressed upon the counsel for the petitioner not to repeat any question which has already been put to the witnesses in their cross examination by the earlier counsel.

""Furthermore, no adjournment will be sought by him on any ground whatsoever. Keeping in view the mandate of section 309 CrPC (power to postpone or adjourn proceedings), the cross examination will be conducted on day-to-day basis,"" the court said.

It also clarified ""that in case for any reason any witness is not available for the purpose of further cross examination, his/her testimony shall be read in evidence as it is"", and disposed of the petition.

While partly allowing the accused's plea, the court also said that if he adopts any delaying tactics ""only he would suffer"" as he is in custody.

The court directed the accused to appear before the trial court today at 2 pm ""and a date will be fixed by Additional Sessions Judge for recalling the aforesaid witnesses for the purpose of cross examination and thereafter the matter be proceeded in accordance with law"".

As per the charge sheet filed by the Delhi Police, the incident took place on the night of December 5 last year when the victim, who was working for a finance company in Gurgaon, was headed back home.

She had taken the taxi from Vasant Vihar to go to her house in Inderlok and the accused after taking another route, raped her, police said.

The high court had on February 25 reserved its order on 32-year-old Yadav's plea and had directed the trial court not to pronounce its verdict till today.

Yadav, through his lawyer DK Mishra had sought recall of the 28 prosecution witnesses on the ground that the earlier defence counsel was ""incompetent"".

Mr Mishra had later restricted the list of witnesses he wished to recall to 13, including the victim, who he alleged had improved upon her statements.

He had also alleged that various crucial evidence, including DNA samples and sexual assault kits, had been planted and tampered with.

Advocate Rajesh Mahajan, appearing for Delhi Police, had opposed the plea saying if it is allowed, it will amount to a re-trial.

Earlier, the high court had refused to stay the  ongoing proceedings before a trial court here in the case after Mr Mishra requested the bench that till his plea to recall witnesses to re-examine them is pending before it, the ongoing final arguments be stayed.

The trial court had on February 18 rejected Mr Yadav's plea for recalling witnesses saying there was no change in circumstances except for a change of counsel, which was no ground to allow the application.

The trial in the case had commenced on January 15 and the prosecution had concluded recording its evidence in 17 days by examining 28 witnesses. The accused had not examined any witness in his defence.

The trial court had also recorded the testimony of the accused in which he termed the charge against him as ""false"".

The court on January 13 had framed charges against Mr Yadav under various sections of the IPC for alleged offences of endangering a woman's life while raping her, kidnapping with an intent to compel her for marriage, criminally intimidating and causing hurt.

New Delhi:
The case relating to alleged rape by an Uber cab driver today saw another adjournment, sought by the counsel for the accused driver, in a Delhi court on the ground that the advocate was on bed rest after falling from stairs.
Shiv Kumar Yadav's advocate moved a plea before Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja seeking adjournment of the case for a few days submitting that he has fallen from stairs at his house yesterday and was having back pain and the doctor has advised him bed rest.
 The court, after taking on record the plea of advocate DK Mishra, moved through his fellow lawyer, adjourned the case and fixed the matter for March 4 for hearing the defence's final arguments.
 The lawyer, however, sought the court to fix the matter for March 7 but the judge refused to adjourn the case for six days as the medical record of the counsel showed he was required to take three days bed rest.
 The court had earlier also adjourned the case as sought by the defence counsel on the ground that he was busy in the Delhi High Court with an application in the same matter.
 The court is hearing final arguments of Shiv Kumar Yadav's counsel who had earlier claimed that the Delhi Police were ""hand-in-glove"" with the prosecution to ensure the driver's conviction and that there were several loopholes in the probe.
 According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of December 5 last year when the victim, a finance executive working in Gurgaon, was heading back home.

New Delhi:
Medical and forensic evidence have corroborated the woman's testimony that she was raped by the Uber cab driver who had also tried to force her into unnatural sex, Delhi Police told a city court in Delhi today.

Continuing final arguments, the prosecutor representing the police submitted that there was ample evidence to show that the 25-year-old woman was not a consenting party to the sexual acts of 32-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav as several injuries were found on her body.

""The oral testimony of the woman regarding her injuries finds corroboration with medical evidence. The accused had raped her and also tried to commit unnatural sex with her. The forensic expert has also said in his testimony that on examining the forensic samples of the accused and the victim, it was found that the driver had tried to commit unnatural sex with her,"" Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja.
The prosecutor said that driver Yadav has ""miserably failed"" to bring anything against the forensic evidence.

He argued that the doctors who had examined the victim after the incident also testified that she was raped and there was an attempt to strangulate her.

""There is sufficient evidence on record to convict Yadav for charges framed against him. Prosecution has been able to prove charges for the offences of Sections 376(2)(m), 366, 506 and 323 of the IPC. None of the witnesses have turned hostile,"" Mr Shrivastava said while concluding the prosecution's final arguments.

The court has fixed the case for tomorrow for hearing final arguments of the counsel for the accused.

The court on January 13 had framed charges against Shiv Kumar Yadav under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for alleged offences of endangering a woman's life while raping her, abducting with an intent to compel her for marriage, criminally intimidating and causing hurt.

If convicted in the case, driver Yadav faces a maximum of life imprisonment as punishment.

New Delhi:
US-based radio taxi service Uber has been given a seven-day ultimatum by Delhi government to remove deficiencies in its application for running cabs in the national capital, failing which its plea to procure licence will be rejected.
 Government has also given such final opportunity to another app-based cab service provider 'Serendipity Infolabs Pvt Ltd' to remove deficiencies found its application.
 Uber, which was banned two-and-a-half months ago after one of its drivers allegedly raped a woman, had applied for licence on January 22 to operate app-based taxi booking service through its subsidiary Resource Expert India Pvt Ltd.
 The government, however, had issued a 'deficiency memo' on January 24 asking it to furnish all details before it as mentioned in recently introduced 'Modified Radio Taxi Scheme (2006),' an official said.
 The scheme was finalised on January 1 following the outrage over rape of the woman on December 5 last allegedly inside the Uber cab.
 App-based taxi operator 'Taxi For Sure' and another operator had also applied for licences and similar 'deficiency memo' were served to them as well.
 ""We have issued them a deficiency memo on January 24 and a reminder was also sent in this regard on February 11. Since no reply was received on any of the two communications, we have given them a final opportunity to Uber to furnish the details within seven days,"" said a senior transport department official.
 However, Uber issued a statement later in the evening, saying, ""Uber has been and will continue to work with the authorities. We are evaluating the perceived deficiencies in the time period provided to us by the government.""
 Sources said that the three app-based taxi providers in their applications did not provide full details for procuring a licence according to laid down rules.
 ""In Uber's application, certificate/undertaking for parking of radio taxis was not provided. They also did not mention telephone number, e-mail address and address proof of their registered office in Delhi.
 ""Besides, call centre management details were also not provided in the application,"" a top source said.
 Sources also said that in the application of Taxi For Sure, details of drivers and undertaking of induction schedule were not provided.
 ""Certificate/undertaking for parking of radio taxis was not provided in Taxi For Sure's applications. Call centre arrangement details and print out of of web portal were also not provided,"" the source added.
 The official said that besides Uber, a seven-day final ultimatum has been given to 'Serendipity Infolabs Pvt Ltd'.

New York:
New safety measures put in place by taxi service company Uber in India are ""far cries"" from the security provisions riders need, said a lawyer for the Indian woman, allegedly raped in New Delhi by a driver of the firm.
""Additions of a panic button and ride share notification to the Uber app in India are far cries from the safety measures riders need,"" prominent New York attorney Douglas Wigdor said in a statement today.
 Mr Wigdor said ""most unfortunately,"" neither of these measures would have prevented the rape of his client. He termed them as ""yet another obvious marketing ploy"" to garner the support of the people of Delhi ""who deserve more"".
 ""Hopefully our lawsuit will bring about real change so that others are not needlessly placed in harm's way,"" he said.
 The Indian woman, who was allegedly raped by Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav in December last year while she was returning home at night, has sued Uber in a California court, seeking unspecified damages and alleging that Uber does not adequately screen its drivers.
 Beginning today, Uber has launched an in-app panic (SOS) button that would allow a rider to alert the local police at the push of a button in case of an emergency. It will also introduce a safety net feature, which would allow users to easily share their trip details and real-time location with up to five friends and family members.
 Last week, the company said it has also established a dedicated local 'Incident Response Team' that oversees and responds to incidents against property and person reported by riders and will also receive a notification, in addition to the local police, when the in-app panic button is pressed.
 It said the specialised team, which would assist local law enforcement officers during distress situations, has completed an extensive training programme by the company's US safety experts and would be reachable 24*7. Uber has said that it would launch the ""significant"" safety features as part of steps being taken by it to ensure safety, transparency and accountability for its customers.
 Last week, Uber had also launched a nationwide third party driver screening programme in India with First Advantage, a global firm specialising in background checks.
 Uber said it was an important step in building an industry first background check process for every one of the many thousands of driver-partners on the Uber platform in
India.
 In the lawsuit, Mr Wigdor said Uber's focus on ""bottom line"" over the safety of its passengers has resulted in ""what can only be described as modern day electronic hitchhiking.""

Women in a Rohtak village protesting the brutal gang-rape and murder of a woman last week
Rohtak:
Five days after a woman's naked, half-eaten body was found in Haryana's Rohtak, with sticks and stones inserted in her, the police claim to have arrested eight men who have allegedly confessed to gang-raping and killing her.

The 28-year-old woman's body was found gnawed at by animals and with key organs missing; two arms and the left side of the body was gone. The police said sticks, stones and condoms were stuffed into her private parts.

""I have never seen such a horrific case in 30 years. The injuries suggest she was hit on the head with a heavy object, became partly unconscious and was then gang-raped. Animals and rodents had eaten bits of the body,"" said SK Dattarwal, who headed the post mortem examination.

All the arrested men are from one village nine km from Rohtak. The police are searching for a ninth man for the savage attack that has been compared to the 2012 gang-rape and torture of a young medical student in a moving bus.

The woman's mutilated body was found on February 4, three days after she was reported missing by her sister.

""The police did not take my complaint seriously. They said you keep looking for her...you will find her or maybe she will return. If they had acted promptly, she would have been alive,"" the sister said, adding, ""We want the killers to be hanged.""

As they confronted public fury, the police prayed for luck in cracking the case.

""We are not lacking in manpower or vehicles. The one thing we are short of is luck. If luck is with us, then we will solve the case,"" said Chandigarh police chief Yashpal Singal, who is in Rohtak to oversee the investigations.

The woman had come from Nepal three months ago and was staying with her sister while being treated at a hospital. The police say one of the arrested men is a Nepali national.

Haryana, which has among the worst records of sexual crimes in the country, was chosen for the launch of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""Beti Bachao, Beti Padao (Save girls, educate girls)"" campaign for the girl child last month.

Rohtak:
A mentally challenged woman's savage rape and murder in a town 80 km from Delhi has spurred chilling comparisons to the 2012 gang-rape in the capital.

The 28-year-old woman's naked body was found in a field near the highway in Haryana's Rohtak, half eaten by animals and with key organs missing. The police said objects had been inserted into her; sticks, stones and condoms were stuffed into her private parts.

""I have never seen such a horrific case in 30 years. The injuries suggest she was hit on the head with a heavy object, became part unconscious and was then gang-raped. Stones were inserted in her before she was dumped,"" said SK Dattarwal, who headed the post mortem examination.

The mutilated body was found three days after the woman was reported missing by her sister.

""The police did not take my complaint seriously. They said you keep looking for her...you will find her or maybe she will return. If they had acted promptly, she would have been alive,"" the sister said, adding, ""We want the killers to be hanged.""

As they confronted public fury, the police prayed for luck in hunting down the attackers.

""We are not lacking in manpower or vehicles. We are only short of luck. If luck is with us, then we will solve the case,"" said Chandigarh police chief Yashpal Singal, who is in Rohtak to oversee the investigations.

The woman had come from Nepal a few months ago and was staying with her sister while being treated at a hospital.
Protesters blocked the national highway on Sunday as details emerged of the brutal attack and the apparent reluctance of the police to act at first.

""We have asked for a report and any errant officer will be charged,"" said Mr Singal.

The police in Rohtak have announced a five lakh rupee reward for information on the attackers.

They deny that they are struggling with the case.

""There are some good clues but I don't want to give any running commentary because that will go against the case,"" said Mohd Akil Ahmed, a senior Rohtak police officer.

In 2012, the fatal gang-rape of a student on a moving bus in New Delhi led to a massive public outcry and tougher laws to deter rapists.

New Delhi:
A forensic expert today told a Delhi court that samples, lifted from Uber cab in which the driver had allegedly raped a woman last month, had matched with the DNA profiling of the accused and the victim.

In his submission that gave a shot in the arm to the prosecution in the rape case, Dr B K Mahapatra, senior scientific officer of CBI's Central Forensic Lab, said ""DNA profiling generated from blood recovered from the car, forwarded to our laboratory, was found to be matching with the complainant (victim).""

Mr Mahapatra said he had conducted the forensic examination of the samples which included blood, saliva, nail clipping, semen of the accused, vaginal swab of the victim, collected by the doctors during their medical examination.

The expert deposed before Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja that he had inspected the Swift Dzire car in which the alleged incident had taken place on the night of December 5, 2014, and had lifted samples for DNA tests.

Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava said the expert has supported the prosecution version and the scientific reports, including DNA analysis, have together strengthened the case.

During the hearing, the forensic expert also deposed that several samples have not matched with the DNA profiling of 32 -year-old driver Shiv Kumar Yadav.

The expert's statement remained inconclusive and his cross-examination by the defence counsel would continue tomorrow.

The court also recorded statements of two officials of Uttar Pradesh Police.

The court had earlier recorded statements of 23 witnesses including the victim who had identified Yadav as the one who had raped her when she was returning home in west Delhi's Inderlok.

Douglas H. Wigdor, the lawyer of the Uber rape survivor, has said that the radio taxi service had emailed her to inform her it that ""has re-entered the market in Delhi.""  

The financial executive was raped in December, allegedly by a driver of the taxi service, who has since been arrested.

Here is the statement by the lawyer: 

According to a news report and an email that they had the audacity to send directly to my client, Uber has announced, just weeks after the tragic rape of my client and during the criminal trial of the Uber driver, that it has re-entered the market in Delhi.  While we have no doubt that Uber is focused on it's bottom-line, we are surprised by this development as we had made it clear to Uber that the rape victim wanted to be part of a consultation process regarding safety procedures to ensure that no other person becomes a victim at the hands of an Uber driver.  Most unfortunately, this has not happened and we have no confidence that the touted ""India-specific safety measures"" will prevent another attack.

New Delhi:
US taxi-hailing app maker Uber Technologies Inc has restarted services in Delhi after a ban following rape allegations against one of its drivers, but a government official said the company remains blacklisted.

The US-based lawyer hired by the financial  executive who was raped in December said Uber had emailed her to inform her it ""has re-entered the market in Delhi.""   

The lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, said that, ""We had made it clear to Uber that the rape victim wanted to be part of a consultation process regarding safety procedures to ensure that no other person becomes a victim at the hands of an Uber driver.""  

Uber's app showed taxis available in New Delhi on Friday. The company has applied for a radio taxi license, a spokesman said to Reuters.  

""They can't start operations,"" said a senior transport official, who was not authorised to speak with the media on the matter and so declined to be identified. ""They don't have a license yet, they have only applied for it.""

India is Uber's largest market outside of the United States by number of cities covered. The company said it would introduce additional safety measures including more stringent driver checks, an in-app emergency button and a dedicated incident response team.

""We are setting an even higher standard than current industry requirements,"" Uber said in a statement.

After a financial executive said she was raped by a driver last month, Delhi's government banned Uber and other taxi-hailing app providers from operating in the city. Uber later said it did not carry out background checks on drivers in India, and authorities revealed the suspect was on bail for sexual assault

The driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav , is being tried in a fast-track court on the capital.

Mr Wigdor was hired by the survivor earlier this month.  Mr Wigdor was the lawyer for Nafissatou Diallo, the New York hotel maid, who accused Dominique Strass-Kahn of assaulting her in a hotel in 2011; he was chief of the International Monetary Fund at the time. The case was reportedly settled for six million dollars.

Online taxi-hailing service Uber has applied for a radio taxi licence and will restart operations in Delhi, after it was banned following allegations that one of its drivers raped a female passenger, an unnamed company spokesman said to news agency Reuters.

Uber will improve passenger safety by introducing additional safety measures including more stringent driver checks, an in-app emergency button and a dedicated incident response team, the company said.

The Delhi government blacklisted Uber from operating in the capital after the woman filed a police case.

File photo: Shiv Kumar Yadav at a Delhi court.
New Delhi:
The finance executive who has accused an Uber driver of raping her in Delhi has asked a top New York lawyer to examine whether she can sue the app-based taxi service for negligence in the US, her family told NDTV today. Uber is headquartered in San Francisco.

""We have been in talks over the last few weeks, which led to me being retained,"" the New York-based employment lawyer Douglas Wigdor said in an email to Reuters, declining to comment on the basis or timing of any case.

The 27-year-old was raped in December in Delhi. She says she fell asleep in the cab on her way home from dinner and was then taken to a deserted area not far from her home in north Delhi where the driver raped her and threatened to violate her with an iron rod, a barbarous tactic used in the fatal gang-rape of a young student on a moving bus two years ago in the capital.

The driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, is being tried by a fast-track court in the capital. He was identified yesterday by the woman as the attacker, said the public prosecutor to reporters on Thursday.

Uber was banned in Delhi after the sexual assault. The government said it had failed to conduct basic background checks of its drivers. The company said there were no defined rules in India on background checks for commercial transport licences.

Mr Wigdor was the lawyer for Nafissatou Diallo, the New York hotel maid, who accused Dominique Strass-Kahn of assaulting her in a hotel in 2011; he was chief of the International Monetary Fund at the time. The case was reportedly settled for six million dollars.

New Delhi:
A woman allegedly raped in an Uber taxi in Delhi ""confidently"" gave evidence today against the driver at the start of his trial in a fast-track court, the prosecutor said.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, kidnap and criminal intimidation after he allegedly attacked his female passenger as she returned home from dinner with friends in December.

""She (the alleged victim) gave her statement confidently. She saw the man and immediately said: 'He is the person',"" public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told reporters.

Uber was banned from operating in Delhi after the attack, with authorities accusing the web-based firm of failing to perform adequate background checks on its drivers.

Yadav's trial is starting less than six weeks after the assault, and in a special court that was set up two years ago in the wake of a fatal gang-rape of a physiotherapy student.

The horrific attack on a moving bus in Delhi triggered mass protests and outrage over violence against women in India.

The Uber case was adjourned until Friday when the woman is expected to be cross-examined by Yadav's lawyers.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court today framed charges and decided to commence day-to-day trial from Thursday in the rape case involving the driver of US-based cab service provider Uber, who created a drama in the courtroom alleging he was not given a fair chance to defend himself.

Paving the way for trial, Additional Sessions Judge Kaveri Baweja framed charges against Shiv Kumar Yadav under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for alleged offences of endangering a woman's life while raping her, kidnapping her with an intent to compel her for marriage, criminally intimidating and causing hurt.

""The trial will proceed on a day-to-day basis from January 15 and prosecutrix would be examined first,"" the judge said after Yadav pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against him.

The police had filed the charge sheet 19 days after the incident on the night of December 5 last year when the 25-year-old victim, who was working for a finance company in Gurgaon, was raped while returning back home in Delhi's Inderlok area.

At the outset, when the judge asked 32-year-old Yadav to sign the charge order sheet, he created a drama alleging that he would not sign it as the arguments on framing of charges were not advanced in the court in his presence.

""I will not sign it. I will appoint a different lawyer. I was not given time to engage an advocate of my choice. I am not getting a chance to present my case. ... You can cut my hand ... but neither will I write anything nor will I sign it,"" Yadav told the judge.

On his refusal, the judge asked him ""How can you say you were not present in the court when the arguments on charges were going on. At that time you were sitting in the court and you have chosen your counsel of your own and he had advanced the arguments on your behalf.""

Later, after being assured by the judge that nothing wrong was being done to him and all legal procedures were being followed by the court, he agreed and gave it in writing that he was signing the order on charge at his own will.

Earlier, Special Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava had asserted that scientific, medical and other evidence showed beyond doubt that Yadav had raped the woman passenger.

The police say they have found the man who allegedly raped, tortured and killed a woman in a Vasant Kunj nursery
New Delhi:
Two days after a woman was found brutalized and murdered in a park in south Delhi's Vasant Kunj area, the police say they have arrested the killer - a man she had allegedly known for several months. The accused, Ramtez, worked in a government-run nursery near the park and was caught near the city's border on Sunday evening.

The body of the woman, a mother of three, was found on Saturday morning in a semi-naked state, with the hands and legs tied and bearing signs of torture, in a chilling reminder of the December 2012 gang-rape case. The police said she had been violated with a stick and strangled with her own scarf.

The police say the woman's mobile phone, salary and jewellery were found on Ramtez, a former neighbor who used to meet her often at the park.

Ramtez and the woman reportedly had a fight on Saturday evening. He allegedly raped and strangled her in a fit of jealous rage. The police say the killing suggests the work of a hardened criminal; they are checking his past crime record.

The woman, believed to be around 40 years old, was the only earning member of her family. Her husband, a security guard, had met with an accident last year. She had reportedly started working in a factory two months ago.

She has three daughters, aged between 9 and 15.

On Friday, she left for work at around 9:30 am and never returned. Late in the evening, her daughters went to the factory with their father to look for her. The family later went to the police.

The woman's body was found with her hands and legs tied while her clothes were in a disheveled condition.
New Delhi:
A woman has been found murdered and violated with a stick in Delhi's Vasant Kunj, in a chilling reminder of the December 2012 gangrape case in Delhi.

The body of the woman, with her hands and legs tied, was found in a closed government nursery on Saturday morning. The police suspect she had been gangraped before being killed. The postmortem report is awaited.

A security guard at the nursery informed the police around 8 am after the body was discovered. A case of murder has been registered.

""She seems to have been strangulated with a scarf she was wearing,"" said Prem Nath, Deputy Commissioner of Police, South.

The woman, who was around 40 years old and a mother of three, was the only earning member of her family. Her husband, who used to work as a security guard, had met with an accident last March. Two months ago, she had got a job in a factory, where she did embroidery work.

She has three daughters, aged between 15 and 9.

On Friday, she had left for work around 9:30 am. But when she did not return till late evening, her family informed the police.

Police have detained three workers from the factory for questioning. They are also looking for the man who often escorted her home when she finished work late.

Her daughters said she had been escorted by the man on Thursday too, when she had reached home around 10 pm. The girls also said their mother had an argument with the factory's head tailor, but did not know what the argument was about.

On Friday, when she did not return by 10 pm, they went to the factory with their father looking for her. When they were told the factory had been shut for the night, the family approached the police.

New Delhi:
The Delhi government today decided to continue with the ban on app-based cab booking company Uber and has asked it to fulfill the conditions for taxi operations in the national capital before seeking revocation of punitive action.

Transport department had given a hearing to the US-based cab service provider following a directive from the Delhi High Court.

""Transport department has decided to continue the ban on Uber till they fulfill the conditions laid down in recently modified Radio Taxi-2006 and under which, taxi service providers must need to register themselves with transport department,"" said a source.

Sources said that Uber wanted to operate its taxis in the national capital without going for registration, but the transport department ruled it out.

According to the transport department, all taxi aggregators, including app-based cab service, will have to register themselves with the department and will also be responsible for their driver's behaviour.

Transport department had on December 26 modified the Radio Taxi Scheme 2006, making specific guidelines for their operation, which include mandatory installation of GPS devices, a panic button and providing of full database of their drivers to city police.

Delhi government had banned web-based taxi booking services, including Uber on December 8 following outrage over the rape of a 27-year-old financial executive allegedly by a driver of the Uber cab, which operates through mobile application.

""According to new rules, radio taxi should be fitted with a GPS and GPRS-based tracking device, printer, and a display panel showing the path traversed and total distance covered,"" the new guidelines states.

""Radio taxi provider should have a registered office in the city and details of its headquarter including telephone number, e-mail ID will have to be provided by them to the transport department,"" according to the guidelines.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber cab driver who allegedly raped a woman passenger.
New Delhi:
Delhi Police today filed in a charge sheet against a driver of US-based cab service provider Uber, 19 days after he allegedly raped a 27-year-old woman executive.

The charge sheet was filed against 32-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav for the alleged offences punishable under sections 376 (rape), 366 (kidnapping or abducting woman with an intent to
compel her for marriage), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.

Metropolitan Magistrate Ajay Kumar Malik fixed the over 100-page charge sheet for consideration on January 2 and also extended the judicial custody of the driver till then.

The investigating officer told the court that the police have cited 44 prosecution witnesses in support of their case.

The police said that they have relied on the forensic evidence and also placed on record the route map of the car in which the offence was committed.

According to the police, the ordeal took place during the two-and-a-half hours the passenger had to spend in the cab after being picked up by the driver.

Mr Yadav was produced before the magistrate after the expiry of his 13-day judicial custody. His wife was also present during the hearing.

Mr Yadav had allegedly raped the woman on the night of December 5 when the victim, who works for a finance company in Gurgaon, was headed back to her home in north Delhi's Inderlok area.

He was arrested on December 7 from Mathura in a joint operation by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh Police and produced before the court on December 8.

New Delhi:
On the second anniversary of the December 16 gangrape case, Delhi Police Commissioner BS Bassi today said that the sudden rise in the graph of crime against woman in the city means that the fairer sex is more confident to report such incidents today then it was two years ago.

The police chief also said that he would be satisfied only when there is zero crime against women in the national capital.

""I would like to tell you that after December 16 incident, women feel more confident to report about the incidents. Changes made in the law have also helped,"" he said.

There has been a sudden spurt in crime against women in the national capital since 2012. The number of FIRs registered for rape rose from 680 in 2012 to 1,559 cases in 2013 and 1,925 cases till November this year.

The number of molestation cases has also gone up from 615 in 2012 to 3,347 last year and 3,932 cases (till November).

""We want to bring the number of crime against woman to zero in Delhi. Society should also change, policemen have also been sensitized,"" said Bassi.

""The number proves that the victims are now coming out openly to complain. We want the women of Dehi to become braver. In the last one year, we have imparted self-defence training to 14,000 women"", he added.

He also said they would be distributing pepper spray to 1,000 women.

Delhi Police is taking all steps to ensure that crimes against women are not suppressed, Bassi said, adding that a number of steps have been taken by the force to ensure that woman who to come to Police Station their grievances are heard effectively and investigation is carried out and culprits brought to book.

""In this regard I would like to tell you that the number of 100 distress help line which used to be 60 has been increased to 100. The woman helpline number 1091 which used to have four lines has been increased to 10"", he said.

Bassi also pointed out that in every territorial police station in Delhi, at least 8 to 10 woman officials and at every police station we are having a woman helpdesk 24x7. So any woman who comes to the Police Station with any grievances, her complaint is heard by a woman police officer and thereafter whatever is necessary is done. Particularly in rape case, all investigations are done by woman cops.

The top cop also said that the government has decided to increase the number of women personnel in Delhi Police. A total of 1,250 women constables have been hired and they will be on the streets of the national capital after around eight months and more will join soon.

New Delhi:
On the second anniversary of December 16 gang-rape incident, Delhi Lt Governor Najeeb Jung today said several steps have been taken to ensure women security in the national capital but there is still a need for social awareness in the society to bring an end to such cases.

""Delhi was ashamed when this incident took place and it continues to feel ashamed. We have taken lesson from it. We have opened women cell at every police station and have also increased the number of CCTVs in view of women security.

""Trauma Centres are also being built at hospitals,"" Jung told reporters on the sidelines of an award function for Delhi University lecturers.

The LG said if girls in the national capital still feel unsafe, it was not due to steps not being taken to ensure women security but because there is a need for change in mindset and social awareness in the society.

""Girls continue to feel unsafe, but it doesn't mean that steps have not been taken to ensure women security. The response time of PCR vans has decreased and it is now just 3-4 minutes. 181 helpline has also been started,"" he said.

""The important fact is that we should bring social awareness in the society. We need to find out the reason why men behave in such manner in Delhi and we should also ask this question to ourselves. Administration cannot do things beyond a limit...it mostly depends on the society,"" he added.

A 23-year-old physiotherapy intern was gang-raped, and brutally sexually assaulted by six men, including a juvenile, in a moving bus on December 16, 2012. The accused then threw her and her male companion out of the vehicle, to die by the roadside on the cold December night.

Had our system been stronger, this crime would not have taken place, Delhi braveheart's father told NDTV
New Delhi:
They watched their daughter die after a barbaric gang-rape on December 16, 2012, and become ""Nirbhaya"" to the nation. Two years on, another rape case has exposed glaring lapses in the system and has saddened them.

Speaking on Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, arrested for allegedly raping a passenger two weeks ago, the Delhi braveheart's father said, ""This man had two previous rape cases, but he was still roaming free. Had our system been stronger, he would not have been out and this crime would not have taken place.""

Yadav snagged a licence to drive a private cab allegedly after faking a character certificate and hiding his criminal record.

""Nothing has changed in two years,"" said the Delhi student's mother, adding, ""All we see is a new crime every day. After what happened to our daughter on December 16... the protests, the changes in law... So many things were proposed but everything is stuck.""

""We have not got justice. Each day is like a year. There has been no hearing in the Supreme Court for six months. We don't know where to go,"" she said.

Six men, including a teenager, were arrested for raping and torturing the 23-year-old on a moving bus in Delhi. Four men have been sentenced to death and Ram Singh, the alleged ring-leader, was found dead in his prison cell. The sixth, who was a few months short of 18 when he was arrested, was sent to three years in remand home.

The juvenile's lighter punishment sparked a debate on whether India is soft on young offenders.

""Crime against women should be stopped with strong laws. Our system is flawed, that is how the juvenile was spared,"" said the parents.

Two years after December 16 gang-rape, are Delhi's buses any safer?
New Delhi:
On December 16, 2012, a young student was gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi and tortured so brutally that she died of severe internal injuries 16 days later. The crime shook India to the core and triggered nationwide soul searching that led to new safety rules and tougher laws.

Exactly two years later, NDTV finds that using public transport remains almost as unsafe for women as before.

The first bus that we tested had no working CCTV or GPS. Instead of a CCTV, there are some wires that betray half-hearted effort. There is a GPS, but the driver says, ""It has not been working since yesterday.""

On the second bus, there is no CCTV but there is a GPS. There are two panic buttons on the bus, a new vehicle commissioned after the Delhi gang-rape. If anyone in distress presses the red button, the bus should stop immediately.  We pressed the button repeatedly, but no one reacted.

""The button works,"" the driver claimed. Then why didn't he stop the bus? The answer was baffling. ""The bus will only stop at the stand,"" he said.

Auto-rickshaws, used by thousands of women every day, are no better.

We speak to the driver of an auto that has a new fare meter with the added feature of a panic button installed after the 2012 rape.
Again, we find that the panic button is present only in spirit.

""We have no idea about this button,"" said the auto-driver, who has been driving on Delhi's roads for 17 years. ""It is useless for us,"" he shrugged.

Only half the buses and autos of Delhi have GPS. Only half the buses have night guards.

The rape of a passenger inside an Uber cab two weeks ago exposed the lack of safety even in private taxis.

More than half the police stations miss a special help desk with a policewoman in charge, to respond to crimes against women. Of 3,000 posts, some 1,700 remain unfilled.

A retired judge who recommended an action plan for safety after the Delhi gang-rape is disappointed.

""There is no coordination between the transport department and the traffic police. Much of the crime can be stopped if they communicate,"" said Justice Usha Mehra.

The transport department, which issues commercial driving licenses, has been accused of letting rules slide while handing out documents to people like Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver arrested for allegedly raping a woman in his taxi. Yadav had a criminal record that included two past rape charges.

New Delhi:
A day ahead of the second anniversary of the December 16 gangrape, Delhi Police today launched an initiative under which girls from underprivileged strata of the society will be trained in driving and self-defence with an aim to empower them both physically and financially.

Police will tie up with licenced radio taxi service providers like Meru, Easycabs and others who can employ these girls for their fleet.

The first such batch of 100 girls enrolled themselves with North district police here today. These girls will now be divided into various batches and will be called in morning, afternoon and evening as per their convenience and trained to drive cars and learn self defence.

""Some driving schools have volunteered to provide vehicles and trainers to these girls. Representatives of RWAs and public persons have also agreed to provide vehicles for this training. Women police officials who are proficient in driving cars will also teach after their duty hours in spare police vehicles,"" said Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Madhur Verma.

Police had contacted BPL and underprivileged families living in the area of each police station through the volunteers of the Parivartan scheme.

""The response to the scheme has been very good, parents brought their girls to get them enrolled into the scheme. We want to act as a link between taxi service providers and the girls.

""We are planning to rope the cab services at the preliminary stage itself so that if they want they can join us at the training stage itself. They can raise an all-women fleet and I am sure, there would be women customers in Delhi who would be ready to pay a little extra for a women-driven cab,"" said Verma.

This assumes significance in the aftermath of the recent Uber rape case where a young financial executive was allegedly raped by the driver of the cab she had hired on the night of December 5 to return from South Delhi's Vasant Vihar to her North Delhi home.

These girls will also be given self defence training by our woman constables who are black belt themselves. This would help them to cope up with any situation and also raise their confidence.

""We will only act as a platform and create a trained supply pool for the cab services. We will keep them motivated throughout the process, however lengthy it may be and ensure to ward off any discouragement which comes there way from the society,"" said Verma.

Some of these girls already have licences while those who don't have will have to apply for learning licence. Police will help them to expedite the process

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber cab driver arrested for allegedly raping a woman passenger
New Delhi:
In a first, Delhi Police got its district DCP tweeting live updates about every development in the investigation of the Uber rape case registering its presence on social media.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Madhur Verma under whose jurisdiction the incident had taken place, tweeted through his official handle @DCP_North_Delhi during the investigation of the case.

Unlike the December 16 case, Delhi Police has been appreciated for speedy investigation in the case and even the father of the victim had offered to give cash award of Rs 1 lakh to the police personnel investigating the case which the officials politely refused saying that it's part of their job.

""Questioning of Uber's Asia head Eric Alexander revealed that Uber needs major improvements to reach the safety standards what they promise,"" said one of Verma's tweet on December 10 after police questioned the Hongkong-based Uber executive.

The same evening when Nidhi Shah, a US-based woman tweeted about alleged indecent behaviour of the Uber rape case accused during her India visit in November, Verma had contacted her on twitter to register a complaint.

""@nps2113 A formal police complaint can be received through E-mail also. It is must to set the criminal justice system in motion,"" he had tweeted. Since then, police is in contact with Shah for filing a formal complaint.

The officer, who has been lauded both online and offline for his efforts in handling the case, got the number of his followers swell to more than 2.5 thousand after he started tweeting about the case.

His followers included a number of senior journalists, celebrities and activists New Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi had on December 11 praised his active role in solving the case and congratulated police for arresting the accused Shiv Kumar Yadav from Mathura within 36 hours of the incident.

The young IPS officer, who had earlier handled high-profile cases like the maid torture case where BSP MP Dhananjay Singh and his doctor wife were arrested, supervised the entire search operation for 32-year-old accused driver and ensured a professional investigation.

""When junior officials could not find any contact number of Uber on its website or through any other source, Verma downloaded the App on his mobile and booked a cab. When the cab arrived, he asked the driver to drive the Sarai Rohilla SHO to its office in Gurgaon from where investigators got the first breakthrough in the case,"" said an officer associated with the case.

Neeraj Kumar, the then Delhi Police Commissioner, at the end of his term blamed poor public relations for the bad name his force had got for the way it handled the December 16 gangrape case and the subsequent protests.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, who was driving the Uber cab, had allegedly raped a woman, working for a finance company in Gurgaon, on December 5 when she was heading back home in north Delhi's Inderlok area.

Uber drivers protest at Jantar Mantar against the ban on the cab service in Delhi
New Delhi:
Hundreds of cab drivers employed with Uber, the internet-based taxi firm, today staged a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi, demanding revocation of the ban imposed on the company's operations in the national capital.

The protesters said their livelihood was getting affected by the ban which was imposed after a 27-year-old woman, finance executive, was raped allegedly by an Uber driver last week.
Ranjit Ray, who has been working with the company since it started its services in Delhi, said Uber's operations were transparent and it had also helped several drivers get finance from banks to buy their own cars.

""Uber helped me get a loan and I bought my own car two months back. It made me independent. The company has always thought about the
welfare of its drivers unlike others. We have been driving taxis for the past so many years. Just because one person is wrong, it is not justified that we all suffer and our only source of livelihood is snatched,"" he said.

Naresh Mehta, who also works for the company, said the accused driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, had an All India Tourist Permit, which is required for any commercial driver in India.

""To get the permit, an applicant needs a driver's badge, issued by the state government after a background check for criminal history. How could the case of rape filed against him go unnoticed during the verification by the state government? Is it (government) not at fault too?"" he said.

""I have a daughter too and we know what the woman and her family is going through. Shiv Kumar Yadav should be punished. But then, we want that all formalities and checks required for the company's registration should be carried out so that it can operate in the city,"" he added.

Another driver employed with the company said, ""Yadav's permit was based on forged documents which clearly indicates the malpractices prevalent in the government departments.""

Cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, accused of raping a woman, outside a court in New Delhi on Monday. (Reuters)
New Delhi:
A Delhi court today remanded the driver of US-based cab service provider Uber, arrested for allegedly raping a 27-year old woman executive, in judicial custody till December 24, amid a ruckus by striking lawyers.

Metropolitan Magistrate Ravindra Kumar Pandey sent Shiv Kumar Yadav to Tihar Jail after the investigating officer said that his custodial interrogation was not necessary as a mobile phone and clothes, which the accused was wearing at the time of the incident, have been recovered.

The officer submitted that the investigation in the case was still on.

The legal aid counsel, appearing for the accused, however, said that the investigation was complete and Yadav be sent to judicial custody.

The court after hearing the submissions said, ""Considering the facts of the case, nature and seriousness of allegations and considering that the investigation is at a crucial stage, the accused be remanded to judicial custody till December 24"".

The moment Yadav was produced in the court, lawyers, who were sitting on a strike for the third consecutive day, created ruckus in the court room and opposed the counsel appearing for him.

The lawyers started shouting, ""We are on strike and no advocate will appear in the proceedings.""

The magistrate then requested the advocates not to interfere with the court proceedings.

32-year-old Yadav, who was driving the cab, had allegedly raped the woman on the night of December 5 when the victim, who works for a finance company in Gurgaon, was headed back to her home in north Delhi's Inderlok area.

Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, accused of raping a woman passenger, outside a court in New Delhi (Agence France-Presse photo)
New Delhi:
A woman in New Delhi who had complained about Uber cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav to the popular app-based taxi service a week before he allegedly raped a passenger, today responded to the Delhi Police by email and asked for legal opinion on how to take forward her complaint.

The Delhi Police are preparing a detailed reply and are likely to tell her that she can file a complaint by email, say sources.

The police had yesterday contacted Nidhi Shah after she said she had complained to Uber about Yadav staring at her during a taxi ride on November 26. He allegedly also told her that the cab's GPS was not working. (A Week Ago, Woman Reported Uber Driver Shiv Kumar Yadav For 'Staring')

The complaint apparently did not lead to any action by Uber, which has been accused by the police of hiring Yadav without basic background checks that would have revealed his criminal record.

Yadav faces multiple cases, which include two for rape, a case of assault on a woman and another for carrying arms. In 2011, he spent seven months in jail for allegedly raping a woman who worked at a pub in Gurgaon but he was later acquitted, the police said. He was accused in another rape case last year in Mainpuri, his hometown in Uttar Pradesh. (Arrested Twice Earlier for Rape: Uber Driver's Chilling Record)

Yadav had a permit to operate a taxi issued by the Transport Department, but the police say that the documents like a character certificate used to obtain that permit were forged. (For Rs 200, a Licence to Drive a Cab: NDTV Expose After Uber Case)

Sources say the Delhi Police have identified the person who forged the certificate for Yadav and are questioning him to find out if any policeman or transport department official was involved.

She has cited the Delhi cab rape in specific and calls for all rapists to be given the death penalty
New Delhi:
Actress and former VJ Shenaz Treasurywala has written an open letter addressed to the men she considers ""most powerful and influential"" in the country - Prime Minister Narendra Modi, actors Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir Khan, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar and industrialist Anil Ambani - asking them to help fight rape and sexual harassment.

The letter - published on the site indicine.com days after a 25-year-old woman was raped in an Uber cab in Delhi - has quickly gone viral.

Shenaz, familiar as a former VJ to those who watched MTV's Most Wanted in the late '90s, writes about being sexually harassed herself, first as a 13-year-old in a marketplace, then while taking public transport to college and later as an aspiring model and actress. She also writes of friends and family having survived sexual assault.

She has cited the Delhi cab rape in specific and calls for all rapists to be given the death penalty - ""NO BAIL. Just Death.""

The cab rape has shocked and shamed a country still reeling from the fatal brutalization of a medical student on a Delhi bus and the gang-rape of a journalist in an abandoned Mumbai mill in the last year. Prominent voices across India have been raised in protest, many of them from the film fraternity that Shenaz belongs to.

Shenaz has appeared in a handful of high-profile movies such as Hum Tum and Delhi Belly. She has a film out tomorrow - Main Aur Mr Riight, co-starring TV actor Barun Sobti.

We reproduce some excerpts from her open letter, available in full on indicine.com , below:

""Dear Narendra Modi, Amitabh Bachchan, Sachin Tendulkar, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, Aamir Khan and Anil Ambani, I am writing to YOU specifically because you are the most powerful and influential MEN in our country. I am writing to you as a woman who grew up in a middle class family in Mumbai. I am writing to YOU for HELP!

""My parents may not like me saying this. I apologize to them if they are reading but this is NOT MY SHAME. It's THIER SHAME.My first experience with the opposite sex, was when I was just 13 and groped by a man (never saw his face but will never forget his hand) while walking in the vegetable market with my mom. She had just given me the worst haircut and as an angry teenager I was upset at her and was lagging behind as she walked ahead. I still remember what I was wearing. It was her dress, mustard with flowers and little bow in the front. How I hate that dress! As if, it was the dress's fault. I was shocked at first. Speechless. He disappeared. I just stood there. Tears started pouring out of my innocent eyes. I told my mom who went mad screaming in the market but who knew where that man disappeared to. I still remember the dirty feeling I had and the number of times I showered in my grand-mom's bathroom after. That feeling never went away.""

""When I was 15, I started going by train and bus to St. Xaviers' College. I was groped and touched and from all angles and this was just how I grew up. Not Just Me but MOST INDIAN WOMEN who don't have the luxury of cars and drivers. As a teenager I would dream of and still sometimes dream that I had a machine gun and could kill all the men who tried to grope me. A very disturbing dream for a kid, don't you think?""

""I developed ways to defend myself, I always carried a bag in front of me, my fist was always clenched, I always turned around every 20 seconds to check who was behind me and a few times I slapped men who touched me, I got slapped back many times too. Sometimes saved by the public, MOST TIMES NOT. My mom begged me not to pick fights with men who touched me, she was afraid of acid being thrown at me or that somebody someday would hurt me badly. She is STILL AFRAID and today she told me not to take an UBER to my meeting tomorrow. Hell ya. BAN UBER! Make everyone take responsibility for this.""

""One of my friends in college was RAPED on the train on her way home in the ladies compartment. She was sick and was going home in the 11:15 break. There was nobody in the first class compartment going back to Bandra at that time, it was a superfast meaning it didn't stop at most stations. He raped her and then jumped off after using her scrunchy (hair tie) to wipe himself. She was the only one on the train and had to limp her way back to her home in Bandra, bleeding profusely. She was just 16. This she felt was her shame so she did not say anything to anyone.""

""What good are all your speeches in the US or Japan or AUSTRALIA- NAMO, if no woman can walk freely in the streets even in broad daylight by herself in the CAPITAL OF OUR COUNTRY. Isn't this a SHAME? SHAME ON YOU SIR.""

""I'm ready to do anything. I'm not a big enough celeb but you Sachin Tendulkar, Amitabh Bachchan, Salman Khan, Sharukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Anil Ambani SIRS- need to speak up as MEN ( you are the men with the power)

SAVE US!

Please demand the Death Sentence for the Rapists.

NO BAIL. Just Death.

Superstars I beg you, please take a stand. Use your Superstardom and Power and MONEY and save the women of our country. SAVE US!

I urge you to protest or go on a fast or do something DRASTIC so people take notice, the government wakes up and CHANGES the LAW so these men are terrified to touch us.

Death to rapists. No bail. Just death.

Imagine Amitabh Bachchan Sir, Aamir Khan, Salmaan Khan, Sachin Tendulkar, Anil Ambani- if you went on a fast or walked to the Rashrtrapati In Delhi. If you, took this stand and made this YOUR NO 1 issue, how much change there would be?!""

New Delhi:
Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who has advised state governments to bar web-based taxi services, announced some new measures for the Capital for women's safety.

In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the ministry said the measures include an increase in the number of police patrol vans and making installation of GPS mandatory in all public utility vehicles.

The measures come after a national outrage over the rape of a woman on Friday, allegedly by the driver of an Uber cab she had hired. (Read: Uber stops booking in Delhi)

The woman was raped apparently 3 km from her house in Inderlok, near the Zakira bridge and the busy Inderlok metro station.  

There are three police stations near the Zakira bridge. Sources say five police vans patrolled the area on Friday night. None had checked the deserted stretch.

Today, a tweet from the home ministry said, ""The number of PCR vans has been increased to 1,000 in Delhi"". ""The government has installed 377 CCTV cameras in Delhi, another 1500 soon,"" said another tweet.  ""Installation of GPS is has been made mandatory in all public utility vehicles,"" said a third.

#WomenSecurityMHAPriorityHelpline no. 100 is currently operating with increased capacity of 100 lines. Earlier it had only 60 lines.
- HMO India (@HMOIndia) December 10, 2014

The car which Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav was driving on Friday night did not have GPS installed. Uber gave its drivers a phone which had GPS, by which the company could track the vehicles. But Yadav had switched off the phone, thereby making the cab untraceable. (Read: No drastic feedback about driver, says Uber)

The installation of GPS and CCTV in buses had been suggested after the fatal gang-rape of a young para-medical student on December 16, 2012 in a moving bus in Delhi. That case too, had evoked a nationwide outrage.

One of the ministry tweets said, ""Conviction rate in rape cases is at 36 percent in Delhi, which is much higher than the national average of 27 percent.""

Cab driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, accused of raping a woman, outside a court in New Delhi on Monday. (Reuters)
New Delhi:
Officials interrogating Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber driver accused for the rape of a 27-year-old woman in Delhi, term him as a ""master of lies"" and a ""highly deceptive"" person.

The 32-year-old taxi driver has emerged as a serial sexual offender and was out on bail in a rape case in 2013, besides being involved in a similar case in 2011.

""He hides most of the things and confesses only about things he knows that we already are aware of. He is a master of lies and highly deceptive. When we ask him about his previous involvements, he tries to give alibis and claims that he has not been convicted in any of them,"" said a senior police official.

After it came to light that he had been accused in at least three cases of rape and one of molestation, investigators were trying to ascertain whether he had victimised other women using his cab.

When asked about it, Yadav gestures in the negative, the official said.

Delhi Police has asked their UP counterparts to provide details of the previous involvements of Yadav to strengthen their case against him. Police want to file a watertight charge sheet against him in the next two weeks and his past criminal record will help them in doing so.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Madhur Verma has spoken to SSP, Mainpuri in this regard and a team will be sent to collect documents.

Yadav, who had studied only till middle school, had allegedly raped a woman in Mainpuri in UP last year and was involved in at least two more cases, including that of a molestation, investigators said.

Yesterday, it emerged that Yadav was arrested in a rape case in South Delhi's Mehrauli area in 2011 and had even spent seven months in Tihar jail. He was, however, acquitted in the case.

He also has two cases under the Goonda Act against him in Mainpuri.

His three day police custody ends tomorrow and he will be produced before a local court. Police are not expected to seek his further custody as they have recovered the iPhone which was provided to him by cab-service firm Uber.

The phone was recovered from Mathura by a Delhi Police team which had gone there with the accused yesterday, according to police.

Protests against the rape of a woman passenger allegedly by a Uber taxi driver in New Delhi (Agence France-Presse photo)
New Delhi:
Delhi Police today questioned Uber's Asia Pacific head, Eric Alexander, as part of an ongoing interrogation of officials of the US-based internet taxi service after one of its drivers was arrested for allegedly raping a woman passenger in New Delhi last week.
Here are the latest developments:
Mr Alexander, who appeared before the Delhi Commission of Women yesterday alongwith senior Uber executives, has been asked by the police to produce employee verification details, the company's database on drivers and other documents.
Uber, which was banned from operating in and around the capital by the Delhi government, has been charged with cheating and violating the law by running its business despite the fact that it had not registered as a taxi service.
Hyderabad today joined Delhi in banning the app-driven cab service with the city's road transport authority saying Uber had no licence to operate and the public had been directed not to use the service.
This comes a day after Home Minister Rajnath Singh advised all states to stop the operation of internet-based taxi services and ensure that only registered services were allowed.
Uber has been accused by the Delhi Police of hiring the driver accused of rape, Shiv Kumar Yadav, without proper background checks and therefore missing his criminal record, which includes two past rape cases, a case of assault on a woman and one for carrying arms.
In 2011, Yadav spent seven months in jail for allegedly raping a woman who worked at a pub in Gurgaon but he was later acquitted, the police said. He was accused in another rape case last year.
A week before a 27-year-old executive was raped allegedly by Yadav, the popular app-based taxi service had received a complaint about him from another woman, Nidhi Shah. She told NDTV she had complained to Uber that Yadav kept staring at her during a taxi ride on November 26 and told her that his GPS was not working.
Along with Uber, nearly 20 other cab services are likely to be blacklisted by the Delhi government, leaving thousands of drivers unemployed, and cutting off women from a service that was seen as safe.
The government has not explained why it did not intervene earlier - services like Uber and Ola, another web-based taxi service, have been advertising their services for months.
Yadav had a permit to operate a taxi issued by the Transport Department, but the police say that the documents like a character certificate used to obtain that permit were forged.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber cab driver arrested for allegedly raping a woman on Friday
Hyderabad:
Hyderabad has become the second city to ban Uber cabs after Delhi, where the arrest of a driver for allegedly raping a passenger last week has turned the spotlight on unregistered internet app based taxi services.

New Delhi:
Despite a ban on Uber cabs in Delhi after the arrest of one of its drivers for rape, they can still be hired. A driver who responded to NDTV's call on Tuesday evening said the internet-based cab service has not informed anyone about the ban. (Also read: Delhi Police Invites Complaints Against 'Rapist' Uber Driver)

When NDTV tried to call an Uber cab using its app, one driver said the company is banned, but the next driver agreed to come after initially refusing a ride to a different destination.

The taxi that came was unmarked and untagged; it had no company logo.

""The company told us nothing. I called and asked whether I am supposed to continue working or not. They said it is up to you - if you think we have been banned then don't drive,"" the driver told the NDTV team. (Read more...)

He also said the company never asked for a character certificate. ""They asked me for a registration, driving licence, my phone number and took my photo,"" he said.

The driver admitted that he could switch off the phone given to him by Uber anytime, which will make it difficult to track him. Asked about a GPS service, which was absent in the taxi in which a passenger was raped last week, the driver said, ""We have it now, but on the phone. I haven't had it installed yet. No one asked me to.""

Uber, an online taxi hailing service, has been accused of hiring Shiv Kumar Yadav, the driver arrested for allegedly raping a passenger on Friday, without proper background checks. Multiple charges against Yadav, including two past rape cases, were overlooked. (Read: A Week Ago, Woman Reported Uber Driver Shiv Kumar Yadav For 'Staring')

The case has directed the government's attention to smartphone-based ""taxi aggregators"" who offer web-app based services and do not follow the rules in place for radio taxi services. After Delhi, Hyderabad has also decided to ban the service. (Read: Uber Cabs Banned in Hyderabad After Delhi Rape)

Home Minister Rajnath Singh had asked all states on Tuesday to stop internet-based cab services and go with only radio taxi services that are registered with the government.

Bharat Mhaske, a cab driver in Mumbai
New Delhi:
The government's decision to ban Web-based taxi services has come as a shock to Parvez Ahmad, a cab driver in Delhi and the only earning member in a family of eight. After this decision, Parvez suddenly finds himself unemployed.

""Whatever I would earn, between Rs. 800-1000 every day, the whole household runs in that,"" he said, pulling out the sticker advertising the Web-based taxi from his car says with distress. ""Punish the person who is guilty, by all means, but why penalise those who are earning honestly. I'm having sleepless nights wondering how I will repay my car loan.""

Just three years ago, Parvez had upgraded from an autorickshaw to a car with the hope of improving his financial standing. Now he is worried about a bank loan of Rs 1.5 lakh that he still has to repay.

In Mumbai too, similar fate awaits Bharat Mhaske, who also has a loan, a dependent family and is on the verge of losing his job. ""I just bought this car during Diwali. I took a loan of 5 lakh on it. How do I repay that if I can't drive the cab?"" he said.

Like Bharat and Parvez, thousands of taxi drivers will have to stay off roads following the government's ban on such services. Service providers like Ola maintain that their drivers pass the stringent compliance check. They also say they are now working on creating an additional layer of GPS tracking in all their cabs.

Many working professionals and users of private taxis have called the ban a knee-jerk reaction. ""I don't think banning is the right thing to do. It's a short cut. Put regulations in place instead of banning and make sure those rules are followed,"" said a college student.

What's even more surprising is that the transport department in the capital has no fix on the number of services and the cars that use their name operating in Delhi, raising serious questions over the government's own regulation systems.

Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, accused of raping a woman passenger, outside a court in New Delhi (Reuters photo)
New Delhi:
The young executive who woke up to find the taxi in which she had dozed off  parked in a secluded spot did not know it at the time, but later would realise that she was barely 3 km from home when she was raped.

The Uber driver, now arrested, later dumped her on the road near her North Delhi neighbourhood. She managed to take a picture of his license plate. Uber, which links customers to taxi drivers through an app, was banned yesterday in the city.

There are three police stations near the Zakira bridge, where the driver parked. Sources say five police vans patrolled the area on Friday night. None checked the deserted stretch that is a few meters from a major metro station, Inderlok.

The case has triggered an angry debate about why so little has changed since a young student was fatally gang-raped on a bus in the Capital two years ago.

That barbaric assault - six men were involved and an iron rod was inserted into the woman - was referred to by the Uber driver, according to his confession to the police. (Read more...)

He warned the 27-year-old executive that if she tried to fight him, he had an iron rod handy.

In December 2012, the bus that served as the scene of a crime that outraged India, circled slowly over a main road, passed undetected through multiple police check points. The tinted windows or the signs declaring it a school bus alerted nobody though it was late at night.

The student and her male companion, who had been beaten, were pushed naked and bleeding onto the road.

In that case, it turned out that the bus should not have been on the road at all - it did not have a valid permit.

The Uber driver's permit to operate a taxi was obtained through forged documents, the police have said. The driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, had been arrested twice before for rape cases - in 2011 and 2013.

New Delhi:
A day after Uber was banned in Delhi because of a rape case involving one of its drivers, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh wrote to state governments, suggesting that any taxi service that is not registered should be blacklisted.

However, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari said a ban on Web-based taxi services like Uber is not the solution to ensuring the safety of passengers. ""New developments are taking place in transport systems through electronics,"" he said, pointing out that the move against Uber is like "" Banning the railways for train accidents, buses for bus accidents.""

Delhi has banned more than 10 firms that provide taxis but are not registered with the government.

Internet-based taxi services like Uber and Ola, which are not new in India, are not regulated, the government said, without offering an explanation for why it had not intervened earlier.  Many point out that a ban is an over-reaction that will leave thousands of drivers jobless and deprive urban commuters - especially women - of the sort of service that allows their journeys to be tracked online via an app.

Though Uber is meant to offer that basic protection, the driver who has been arrested for raping a woman passenger on Friday in Delhi switched off his phone, ensuring that he went off Uber's radar.  His car was not fitted with GPS. Uber had not verified his police record.   

The aggregate of those sizeable lapses resulted in a horrific attack on  young woman and those guilty must be held responsible, said some law-makers in parliament, where the case was discussed. But many pointed out that existing Indian laws are outdated and obvious holes must be plugged, but doing away with app-based services is unwise.

Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, accused of raping a woman passenger, outside a court in New Delhi (Reuters photo)
New Delhi:
Uber driver Shiv Kumar Yadav, arrested for raping a woman passenger on Friday, had been accused of two more rapes earlier. A rape case was filed against him last year in his native place Mainpuri in Uttar Pradesh, it has emerged.
Here are the 10 latest developments in this story:
32-year-old Yadav's criminal record includes a case of assault on a woman in 2003, an arms case in 2006 and a rape case in 2013. He was out on bail.
In 2011, Yadav spent seven months in jail for allegedly raping a woman who worked at a pub in Gurgaon but he was later acquitted, the police said.
Uber, the app-based taxi service, has been charged by the Delhi Police with cheating and defying government orders. An FIR or police case was filed against the company today. Uber executives were questioned today by investigators for the second day in a row.
Uber was banned from operating in and around the capital by the Delhi government yesterday.
The police says the company ignored basic safety checks like scrutinizing the police record of the driver now arrested for rape. His taxi was not equipped with GPS either.
The government says that Uber violated the law by running its business despite the fact that it had not registered as a taxi service. However, it has no explanation for why it did not intervene earlier - services like Uber and Ola, another web-based taxi service, have been advertising their services for months.
Along with Uber, nearly 20 other cab services are likely to be blacklisted by the Delhi government, leaving thousands of drivers unemployed, and cutting off women from a service that was seen as safe.
Home Minister Rajnath Singh has today written to all states to consider banning internet-based taxi services. However, Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari commented that ""Banning services is not a solution to the problem.""
Uber executives questioned by the police have ceded that they did not verify the background of the driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, who joined the firm six months ago.
He had a permit to operate a taxi issued by the Transport Department, but the police says that the documents used to obtain that permit were forged and did not refer to an earlier rape case against Yadav. The police have ordered an enquiry to determine how the papers were forged and accepted by officials.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, the Uber cab driver arrested for allegedly raping a woman on Friday
New Delhi:
The woman who was raped allegedly by an Uber cab driver on Friday texted her friend after the incident but the message, in a chilling mistake, went to her attacker.

""I have been raped by my cab driver,"" the 27-year-old woman texted, after being dumped on the road by the driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav.

The message went to the mobile phone of the last caller, which happened to be the driver, who had left after threatening to come back for her if she told anyone. Yadav had allegedly dialed his own phone from the woman's number and warned her that he would track her down.

Sources say on receiving the woman's message, Yadav decided to leave town and made plans to escape to Nepal with his family, but was caught on Sunday.

In his interrogation, Yadav has admitted to hitting the woman, biting her and trying to strangle her. He said on finding the woman asleep, he drove on and parked the car 4 km ahead of her house.

He admitted that when the woman awoke, he grabbed her by the throat and threatened to shove an iron rod inside her unless she kept quiet - a chilling reminder of the Delhi bus gang-rape case of December 16, 2012.

Yadav, the police said, admitted that he did not stop even though the woman warned him that she had his details and he would get caught.

The driver was arrested after a two-day manhunt from Mathura, around 160 km from Delhi. The rape survivor had taken a photo of the number plate when Yadav finally pushed her out of the car.

The police say before confessing, Yadav first lied and claimed that the woman was a sex worker who had complained as she wanted more money.

Yadav, 32, had been booked in a rape case three years ago as well and spent seven months in jail. The case filed by the police in 2011 said he had raped the woman - a 22-year-old who worked in a Gurgaon pub - at knife point.

New Delhi:
Uber, the app that allows users to hail taxis, has been banned by the Delhi government after one of its drivers was arrested for rape.
Here are the latest developments in this story:
The arrested driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, appeared in court on Monday and was remanded in custody for three days. He allegedly raped a woman passenger on Friday.
He was also arrested in 2011 and jailed for seven months on charges of raping a woman but was later acquitted, the police said.
A certificate declaring that he had no criminal record, meant to be issued by the police, was allegedly forged. This certificate was submitted to the transport department to get Yadav a permit to run his taxi. Delhi Police is now trying to determine who forged the certificate.
The Delhi Police has registered an FIR against the driver for alleged cheating.
Uber executives reportedly told the police on Monday that the company does not run independent background checks on drivers; documents submitted by drivers are not verified.
""Keeping in view the violation and the horrific crime committed by the driver, the transport department has banned all activities relating to providing any transport service by uber.com,"" Special Commissioner Kuldeep Singh Gangar said.
Delhi Police says Uber appears to have ignored the standard procedures for private cab services in the city. For example, GPS had not been installed in the taxi. Uber tracks its drivers through an app, but the driver just has to switch off the phone to disappear off the map.
Yadav, 32, has allegedly confessed that he drove the woman to an isolated part of the capital after he saw her sleeping in the car. After the sexual assault, he drove toward the woman's neighbourhood in North Delhi and abandoned her on the road, he has reportedly said in his confession.
A statement by Uber CEO Travis seemed to put the blame partly on Indian authorities. ""We will work with the government to establish clear background checks currently absent in their commercial transportation licensing programs,"" he said.
Yadav, who was signed on by Uber six months ago, was arrested in his village in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday evening. He had abandoned the taxi he owned a day before that.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, accused of raping a woman passenger, has been remanded in police custody for three days.
New Delhi:
Shiv Kumar Yadav, a driver with Uber who has been arrested for allegedly raping a woman passenger in Delhi, spent seven months in jail in 2011 on charges of rape.  He was reportedly acquitted, said the police, though details remain unclear.

The Delhi government has today banned Uber from offering any services in and around the capital, alleging that it defaulted on basic safety checks like verifying the police record of the driver. (Read more...)

The FIR or police case against Yadav, now 32, says three years ago, a young woman who worked at a pub in Gurgaon, hailed his taxi. He drove to an isolated spot, held her at knifepoint, and raped her. When she shouted for help, he pushed her onto the road in South Delhi's Vasant Kunj area, said the FIR, which was filed in December 13, 2011.

On Friday evening, Yadav was hired through Uber, the app that connects users with taxis, by a young woman executive in Gurgaon. 

She has told the police she fell asleep in the car and woke up to find it parked in a deserted spot. Yadav then raped her, she said, before driving her to her neighbourhood in North Delhi, where he abandoned her on the road. She managed to take a photo of the car's license plate.

Yadav then drove to Mathura in Uttar Pradesh. He abandoned his car near his village on Saturday and was arrested last evening. He was produced in a court in Delhi today and is now in police custody.

 (Sunetra Choudhury is Associate Editor, National Affairs, NDTV 24x7)

It was one of the most humiliating experiences of my working life. It was my first job in a newspaper and like many other nights, while hunting or waiting for a quote, I was late in returning home. I was in my early 20s, single and living with my parents, and however much I'd tell my parents that my job required me to work late, they'd stay up, worry and crib.

On this particular night, when it was close to midnight as I recall, they called my front office (as it was just before I got a cellphone), and harangued the receptionist till he passed on the line to my Editor. My poor boss, who had no idea about my whereabouts, patiently heard out my frustrated father's lecture on the responsibility of having women working for him. I hated my parents for reducing me to a helpless little girl in front of my boss but fortunately, the only harm it did, was to my sense of pride. Perhaps, my editor was used to receiving such calls from his women employees' families!

I recall this story on a day when I go back to feeling almost as helpless as I did that day. It's been 15 years since - I've learnt to drive, I have my own car, I am responsible for the safety now of my own child, I'm no longer answerable to my parents and can spend the entire night working or partying or doing whatever I want, and yet, the sad part is, I am yet again answerable to someone back home whose valid excuse for checking up on me is that they are worried about how I'll get back home.

For a few years there, we working women in Delhi were living in a mirage of safety provided by radio taxis. We all loved the idea that whenever we knew we'd be late, we could pay a professional group to arrive at our office, at our friend's, at the bar, and take us safely where we needed to go. No more negotiating with fathers about deadlines, no more begging your brother to pick you up, no more of indulging the 'chipko' male friend because he had a car that would drop you home. There was also the end of negotiating the fare and whether a distance was viable for the taxi driver or not. We thought that if our cellphone number, pick up-drop-off location, the driver's name and phone number is fed into a 'computer system', we were safe, weren't we? I guess the air-conditioning in these cabs compared to the 'kaali-peelis' had made our brains cool down too because women like me were satisfied and we couldn't get enough of such a service.

My younger colleagues no longer had dads waiting downstairs at our office for them. They would frequently have girls' night outs and their sullen boyfriends were replaced outside the bar by more reliable ones named Meru and Ola and Mega with flexible pricing. I remember I heard about Uber when my colleague told me, ""I thought I must be drunk because I called a cab and I saw an Audi outside!"" Yes, suddenly we Delhi women thought we were citizens of the world, living lives we were always meant to be. I could come home from work with my driver and then let him go home as I was supposed to, taking a cab later, if I was going for a movie or dinner with my friends. For my night out, I could wear whatever I wanted to, and not worry like I would had I taken the metro. I would sometimes think about forwarding my cab details to my husband but I became so trusting that I banished even those thoughts soon.

And now those thoughts are back. My years of independence as a modern woman living in a global city like Delhi seem to have disappeared like the illusory mirage that they were. The Uber rape has killed my urge to step out and explore my city as an adult like I should. I'm back to requesting another man, my driver, to drop me after his shift to where I want to go. I mourn that loss of independence as my colleagues tell me they deleted their Uber apps, women who said they cancelled their late-night plans this weekend for lack of a safe option.

Maybe our fears will evaporate soon like our sense of outrage and we will go back to using these cab services. Many of us won't have a choice so for our sake, I just hope they fix these safety loopholes soon. I know taking lifts from male acquaintances isn't an option for me. Have you forgotten? More than 90 per cent rapes are committed by men we know.

Delhi Police had to take a cab provided by Uber to find the company's office in Gurgaon.
New Delhi:
Hours after a young woman in Delhi complained that she had been raped by the driver of an Uber taxi driver, the Delhi Police decided to visit the company office. Except, an address for the company, which supplies taxis to users of an app, could not be found.

Top police officers said the app did not offer a local address for the firm.  So a police officer then downloaded the app, hailed a taxi, and asked the driver to head to the Uber office.

What they discovered is that the local branch of Uber, headquartered in San Francisco, is operating from three rooms in a hotel in Gurgaon.  The company raised investment recently that values it at 40 billion dollars.

Uber, which has issued multiple statements condemning the crime and pledging its cooperation to the  investigation, appears to be guilty of a variety of lapses, the police said.  The driver, Shiv Kumar Yadav, who was arrested in Uttar Pradesh on Sunday evening, had been jailed three years ago for seven months in a case of sexual assault.

Uber has not commented on whether it was aware of this criminal record.  Police sources say this is further evidence that the company did not verify the driver's background.  The taxi he owned and used was not fitted with a GPS, making it impossible to track once Yadav switched off his phone, which was loaded with an Uber app used to track the driver's location.

The police will today deliver to Uber a legal notice asking it to join the investigation.  Sources said the company is likely to face a case of negligence, and depending on the findings of the initial enquiry, the charges could be toughened to criminal culpability.

The woman who has alleged rape hired the taxi on Friday night.  She dozed off in the car and woke up to find it parked in a secluded place where the driver assaulted and raped her, before abandoning  her on the road near her home in North Delhi.

Activists of the Aam Aadmi Party protesting outside the residence of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh.
New Delhi:
Several Aam Aadmi Party activists gathered outside Home Minister Rajnath Singh's residence this morning and raised slogans demanding action against taxi service Uber, whose driver has been accused of raping a 27-year-old woman passenger on Friday night.

The home minister, who was attending a book launch in the national capital, said, ""This is extremely unfortunate and shameful... The law will take its own course.""

AAP activists also protested against the government and the Delhi Police over the lack of safety for women in the capital.

""Delhi Police is under Home Ministry, what has the home minister done for women's security, isn't he accountable?"" said AAP member Aatishi outside Rajnath Singh's residence.

The activists were detained by the police.

""At least 100 protestors have been detained for protesting outside the home minister's residence and have been taken to the police station,"" DCP Vijay Singh told news agency IANS.

Soon after the AAP protesters were cleared, it was the turn of the youth wing of the Congress, NSUI, to protest outside Mr Singh's residence. They too were detained by the police.

32-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav, who is accused of raping the 27-year-old finance executive of a Gurgaon-based company, had been with Uber for the last six months. The Delhi Police say he is a repeat offender and was accused of rape in 2011 but his criminal record went unchecked when he was hired. (Read More)

Protests against the rape of a woman passenger allegedly by a Uber taxi driver in New Delhi (Agence France-Presse photo)
New Delhi:
A driver with popular taxi service Uber arrested for allegedly raping a woman passenger in Delhi on Friday is a repeat offender. The Delhi Police say he was accused of rape in 2011 but his criminal record went unchecked when he was hired.

The Delhi police say Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, was imprisoned for seven months in the Tihar jail while being tried for the alleged rape of a 22-year-old employee of a Gurgaon pub, who had hired a cab from outside a mall at around 3.30 am. Shiv Kumar was arrested from his home in Khanpur. He was reportedly let off after a compromise.

How he was hired by the global taxi service without a basic background check is what the police are investigating.

On Friday, Yadav, a father of two, allegedly followed a familiar pattern.

The rape survivor, a 27-year-old finance executive of a Gurgaon-based company, has alleged that she fell asleep in the cab, a Maruti Suzuki Dzire, and woke up to find it parked at a deserted spot and Yadav touching her. The driver then allegedly raped her.

She told the police that the driver dropped her near her home in north Delhi and threatened to shove an iron rod inside her - a chilling reminder of the December 2012 gang-rape of a medical student who was tortured with an iron rod - if she complained.

The only link Uber had with the driver, the police said, was a phone given to him with an app installed. But since he had switched off the phone, it became impossible to track him.

The police say they had to wait for three hours on Saturday at the Uber office to get information on the man. (What it took to find the Uber driver accused of rape)

In a statement on Sunday, Uber said, ""This is an abhorrent crime."" The company claimed its team had immediately provided ""all relevant details.""

The police say a case of negligence can be made out - if Uber had followed safeguards, the rape may have been prevented.

Yadav, who had been driving for Uber for six months, did not go through police verification that is mandatory for cab drivers. Also his car did not have a Global Positioning System.

Shiv Kumar Yadav, accused of raping a woman passenger, was arrested from the outskirts of Mathura in Uttar Pradesh
New Delhi:
It took two days of manhunt and a 25-minute chase on foot in Mathura to catch Shiv Kumar - the driver with popular taxi service Uber, who allegedly raped a young woman passenger in Delhi on Friday night.

Kumar, 32, who had been driving with Uber for six months, had allegedly taken the woman to an isolated spot when she had dozed off in his car while travelling from Vasant Vihar to north Delhi's Inderlok area. He then allegedly molested and then raped the woman.

In her complaint, the woman said he had even threatened her that if she went to the police, he would shove an iron rod inside her, as had been done with the young woman who had got raped in a bus in Delhi on December 16 2012.

Sources in Delhi Police said Kumar had gone home to Mathura on Saturday morning. He told his wife that he had ""got involved in a case"" and that they should be ready to leave home with him. But before he could make his getaway, the police reached Mathura.

When Kumar got to know a police team had arrived, he ran away from home. The police questioned his wife, but she said she did not know where he was, the officer said.

By Sunday morning, the city was flooded with policemen hunting for Kumar.

What helped the police was the knowledge that Kumar was using three phones. One of them, which had the Uber GPS installed, had been switched off to avoid detection. But the police could track the other two, one of which Kumar was using to keep in touch with his wife.

By tracing the calls, the police zeroed in on the area he was calling from - Anandvan colony in the outskirts of Mathura. When they reached, a local, who had seen Kumar, tipped them off.

But when Kumar saw the police arriving, he bolted, the officer said. They could only catch up with him after a 25-minute chase. By then, Kumar had taken refuge inside an abandoned house. The police had to break into the house and arrest him.

Protests outside the Delhi Police headquarters after a woman was raped allegedly by a Uber taxi driver (Associated Press photo)
New Delhi:
A driver with popular taxi service Uber arrested for allegedly raping a woman passenger in Delhi on Friday was involved in a previous rape case. The Delhi Police say had the company subjected Shiv Kumar Yadav, 32, to proper scrutiny, the crime could have been avoided.
Five lapses by Uber according to the Delhi Police:
Uber failed to check that Yadav had a criminal record and was tried for rape in 2011. He did not go through police verification that is mandatory for cab drivers.
The address provided by the company for Yadav turned out to be false.
The mobile number that Yadav was using was shared between three drivers who drove the car on shifts.
The driver did not have the Public Service Vehicle licence required for commercial vehicles. There was no Global Positioning System or GPS in the car.
The only link Uber had with the driver was a phone given to him by the company with its app. Since the mobile phone was switched off, it became impossible to track the driver.

Uber also has a GPS trace and record of all trips that occur on the platform - information that has been shared with the authorities.

We will also work with the community, with government and the technology industry to find more ways to promote safety in transportation, particularly for women - both here in Delhi and throughout India.

The Uber cab in which the woman was raped
New Delhi:
One person has been detained from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh in connection with the rape of a woman passenger, allegedly by a taxi driver on Friday night in Delhi. The police are verifying whether the person detained is the main accused in the case, 32-year-old Shiv Kumar Yadav, who works with Uber, a popular app that supplies taxis to users; he had been missing since the incident.

The 27-year-old woman, who works with a finance company, hired the cab in Gurgaon near Delhi on Friday night after dining with friends. Medical tests have confirmed the financial executive was raped, said police sources.

In a statement this morning, Uber said, ""Our thoughts are with the victim of this terrible crime and we are working with the police as they investigate. We will assist them in any way we can. It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following allegations of a serious incident, which we have done."" (Read Uber's Full Statement)

The woman in her complaint, which does not mention Uber, said that after getting into the cab on Friday night, she fell asleep and woke up to find the car parked at a secluded spot. The driver then allegedly raped her.

She told the police that the driver then dropped her near her home in north Delhi after threatening to kill her if she spoke of the matter to anybody.

""The woman clicked a photograph of the car's number plate and then made a PCR call to report the incident,"" a police officer said.

When an Uber driver is requested via its app, the user is shown a photo of the driver along with his phone number when he is en route. In this case, the suspect's phone was allegedly not registered in his own name. Uber uses GPS installed on drivers' phones to track their locations, but the driver had switched off his phone.

Nihal Chand Meghwal took charge today as Minister of State for Panchayati Raj
New Delhi:
Nihal Chand Meghwal, the union minister named by a woman in a rape case, is ""missing"", say the police in Rajasthan. They say they don't know whether he will show up on Wednesday at a court in Jaipur that has summoned him.

The 43-year-old minister, who has been summoned along with 16 others in the rape case filed in June, was in the spotlight in Delhi today as he took charge of a new department.

Asked by NDTV if he had received the Jaipur court summons, Mr Meghwal said, ""No, I haven't.""

Mr Meghwal, a minister of state, has been shifted from Chemicals and Fertilizers to Panchayati Raj, but he has not been dropped despite the controversy.

He has not been named as a suspect by the police, a fact his party, the BJP has stressed when opposition parties have called for his sacking.

In 2012, the state police investigated the woman's complaint and closed the case. She then moved court, which summoned the minister and others named by her.

In August, when Mr Meghwal did not appear in court, the police in his constituency Ganganagar said they could not find him to serve him summons as he has been staying in Delhi.  The court then ordered Ganganagar Superintendent of Police Hari Prasad Sharma to make sure the minister received the court notice.

The top police officer was present when the minister, on October 30, participated in a ""Run for Unity"" to mark Sardar Patel's birth anniversary. Days before that, he was there to adopt a village.

A lawyer representing the complainant says there is no reason for the police to not track him down during his many visits to Ganganagar.

Sources in Raisinghnagar, the minister's hometown, say he may not appear in court tomorrow.

The case of the ""missing minister"" has been seized by the Congress, which has asked PM Modi to explain. The party's Digvijaya Singh tweeted this morning, ""Missing Minister of GOI ! Modi must respond. How can Rajasthan Govt claim that a Minister in GOI can't be traced ? Good Governance Mr Modi ?"" On Monday, the Congress raised questions on many of the 21 new ministers that have joined the government.

The BJP alleges that Mr Meghwal was framed by the previous Congress government of Rajasthan.

Dhaula Kuan Gangrape: Court to Pronounce Verdict on October 10

New Delhi:
A Delhi court today decided to pronounce on October 10 its verdict in the sensational abduction and gangrape case of a 30-year-old BPO executive from northeast, after the prosecution rebutted the claim of one of the five accused that police had fudged the evidence.
   
The court had posted the matter for today as one of the accused on the scheduled day of the verdict on September 22 had alleged discrepancies in the investigation.
   
Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhatt reserved the verdict after police denied the alleged discrepancies pointed out by the counsel for accused Usman on September 22, minutes before the court was scheduled to pronounce the judgement.
   
Responding to Usman's plea which claimed that blood sample collected from the victim was planted on his pants to ensure matching of DNA samples, public prosecutor Satvinder Kaur said the exhibits were sent for forensic test on November 26, 2010, much before the accused was arrested on December 2, 2010.
   
Kaur reiterated the argument that there was no tampering with the evidence.
   
Usman had claimed that the medical report and statement of the alleged victim had suggested that no external injuries were caused to her.
   
His counsel had also questioned the discrepancies in the statements of investigating officer (IO) and forensic expert over number of exhibits sent during the probe, received by the lab, and packed in different envelopes.
   
Observing that manipulation of blood samples looks highly improbable, the court on September 22 had directed the police to respond to the allegations levelled by Usman.
   
Earlier on September 8, the court had reserved judgement after the final arguments were concluded in the case in which five persons were facing trial.
   
According to police, Shamshad alias Khutkan, Usman alias Kale, Shahid alias Chhota Billi, Iqbal alias Bada Billi and Kamruddin alias Mobile, had allegedly abducted the victim on November 24, 2010 while she was walking home with her friend after her shift had ended.
   
The accused then took the victim to Mongolpuri, allegedly gangraped her, and left her on an isolated road.

File pic: Protests after the Delhi gang-rape in December, 2012
New Delhi:
Minors above 16 accused of crimes like rape will be tried as adults if changes in law proposed by the government go through.

The Centre today moved closer to bringing an amendment in the Juvenile Justice Act. A draft bill approved by the law ministry has been forwarded for cabinet approval. It says juveniles above 16 will be considered ""adults"" when they have been accused of rape or equally severe crimes.

Changes in the current law were spurred by outrage after a minor convicted in the fatal gang-rape of a student in Delhi in December, 2012, was tried in a juvenile court last year and sentenced to three years in a reform home.

The convict was just a few months short of 18 when he and five others assaulted a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern in a moving bus, gang-raped her and tortured her with an iron rod. She died of her injuries a fortnight later, leaving a nation shocked and angry and setting in motion sweeping changes in laws on crimes against women.

Six men were arrested, including the minor. Of the others, Ram Singh, the alleged ring-leader, was found dead in his prison cell and four others have been sentenced to death.

The juvenile's lighter punishment sparked a debate on whether India is soft on young offenders. The girl's parents moved Supreme Court, but their request that the youngest convict be tried and punished as an adult was rejected in March.

The government's push comes days after Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi said that ""50 per cent of all sexual crimes are committed by 16-year-olds who know the Juvenile Justice Act so they can do it.""

A section of human rights activists, however, warn that each case must be treated individual and children under 18 should be given a chance to reform; many of them, they argue, come from poor families and have suffered abuse.

New Delhi:
Girls below 18 years of age have been the victims in most of the rape cases in the national capital and the majority of such cases have happened in residences or involved friends and acquaintances, says a study by Delhi Police.

The study was undertaken following a rise in rape cases in the national capital.

In a whopping 81.22 percent of the rape cases, women were assaulted inside their homes or at the place of the accused, and around 46 percent of rapes were committed on girls below 18 years, a police official told IANS, citing the study.

While neighbours have committed 21 percent of the rapes, friends and acquaintances were involved in 41 percent of the cases.

The study found that in 2.25 percent cases, the woman's father was involved, in 1.25 percent cases the step-father, in 0.6 percent cases a brother, in 1.34 percent cases the ex-husband, in 1.8 percent cases an uncle, in five percent cases a brother-in-law, in 0.3 percent cases a servant and in 3.5 percent cases an employer.

The official, who did not want to be named, said the study looked at rapes that took place between January 2013 and June this year.

Girls in the age group of 16-18 years were attacked in 14 percent cases, in the 12-16 age group in 19.25 percent cases, between 7-12 years in 6.5 percent cases, in the 2-7 age group in 7.75 percent cases.

At least 0.3 percent of the rapes were committed on girls below two years, the official said.

The study said women in the 18-25 age group were targeted in 27.27 percent cases and those above 25 years in 25.48 percent cases.

The assaults took place in shanties (4.5 percent cases), vehicles (1.5 percent), parks (three percent), shops and offices (1.2 percent), hotels and restaurants (2.5 percent) and school and college buildings (0.75 percent).

The study said in 99 percent cases, the rapists were first-timers, while in 1.16 percent cases the accused allegedly committed the crime for the second time.

A total of 1,647 rape cases were reported in Delhi in 2013 while 984 such cases have already been registered in the capital this year.

The study said that in 86 percent of the rapes, a single person was involved while in two percent of the cases two people were involved.

In just 1.5 percent of the rapes, more than two people were involved.

About 64 percent of the women attacked belong to lower income groups.

The police official said the study will help the force take further measures for checking assaults on women.

The city police had taken a series of steps to prevent sexual assaults on women after the gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman student in a bus in December 2012, but the capital continues to record a large number of rapes.

National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson Mamta Sharma told IANS that Delhi Police should also start a sensitization programme, following the study.

""We have been running many programmes on sensitization, in schools and colleges. Police should also start such programmes,"" she said.

Rape on Rise Due to Failure of Live-in Relationships: Delhi High Court

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has held that rape cases are increasing due to failure of live-in relationship or young adults acting immaturely by getting into commitments that end up in break-ups.

A bench of Justice Kailash Gambhir and Justice Sunita Gupta in a recently-delivered order said that boys and girls have to be very careful and cautious before taking such an important decision concerning their lives and entering into the most sanctimonious relationship of marriage or even a live-in relationship.

""One of the major reasons contributing to increase in the rape cases is a failure of live-in relationship or any immature decision on the part of such young adults which more often end up in a broken relationship but sometimes after indulging into physical relationship,"" the court said.

The court observation came while upholding life term awarded to four members of a family, including the girl's father, for killing her lover in October 2006 as they did not approve of their relationship. The incident took place in Uttam Nagar area of west Delhi.

In its order made available on Thursday, the court found that convicts Ravi Kumar, Sanjay, Karamvir and Raj Kumar are brothers of the girl, who were aggrieved by the conduct of Kuldeep as he was having an affair with her which affected their family reputation.

Observing that attractions of two individual leading to relationship is above the barriers of caste, creed, religion and status, the court said: ""Parents are also expected to behave with more sensitivity and maturity as such issues need to be resolved with patience, understanding and tolerance and instead of indifference or with a bent of mind of alienating the two.""

The court said that the precious life of Kuldeep perhaps would not have met such a tragic end and the accused perhaps would not have suffered the severity of punishment of life imprisonment had they acted in a sensible and mature manner with due patience, tolerance and understanding to resolve the things instead of taking the law in their own hands.

Union minister Nihal Chand Meghwal speaks on the rape case filed against him.
New Delhi:
Outside the BJP'S head office in Delhi demands for Minister of State Nihal Chand Meghwal's removal are getting louder. The All India Mahila Congress (AIMC) led a protest demanding his removal. The Congress is questioning the government's claims on zero tolerance for violence against women after serious allegations have been levelled against their own junior minister.

President of the AIMC Shobha Oza said, ""Either he should resign or should be removed. This shows their double standards. In Parliament they claim they are in support of women's safety and then they take no action when it's their own minister.""

The woman who has filed the charges says that in 2011, she was raped by a group of men including Mr Meghwal, who was not a parliamentarian at the time. She says her husband, an aspiring politician and property dealer, forced her to have sex with powerful and connected men in and around Jaipur.

The associates were alleged to include Mr Meghwal and Rajasthan BJP leader Om Prakash Godara.

The trial court dismissed the allegations but now a review petition has been admitted and Mr Meghwal has been summoned by the court.

The woman now wants to meet the PM and has alleged she is under pressure to withdraw the case. She is also seeking police protection.

The BJP though is standing by its minister. ""No one can be protected because he is a minister,"" said Delhi MP Meenakshi Lekhi, adding, ""but you can't falsely implicate someone. Nothing has been proven yet"".

After less than a month in power, roles have reversed with the BJP defending its minister as the opposition is increasing pressure.

Akhilesh Yadav, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, will be in Delhi today to seek global investment in his state, where two more shocking cases of rape have been reported. In one, a 35-year-old woman was allegedly raped by a senior policeman, while his juniors did nothing to stop him.

The woman had reportedly gone to the Sumerpur police station in Hamirpur district of UP to seek the release of her husband, who had been picked up by the cops after a country-made pistol was seized from him.

The policemen allegedly demanded a bribe from the woman, which she refused to pay. She was then allegedly raped by the Station House Officer (SHO), Rahul Pandey. Three constables on duty allegedly did not intervene.

The SHO has been arrested and the constables have been removed from duty.

On Tuesday night, a woman was found hanging from a tree in Bahraich district of UP, in what had chilling similarities to the killing of two young girls who were gang-raped and then murdered two weeks ago in Badaun district.

The girls, aged 14 and 15, too were discovered hanging from a tree.

The woman's son alleged that she was gang-raped and then murdered by her attackers. He said she had recently complained to the police about the local liquor mafia.

Three of the five people named as suspects have been arrested, including the woman's brother-in-law who was allegedly part of the village hooch racket. The autopsy report, however, hasn't confirmed rape. Results of pathological tests that conclusively confirm rape are still awaited. The police has also hinted at the possibility of suicide.

The Badaun case two weeks ago had made international headlines. The chilling image of the two teen cousins hanging from a tree sparked massive outrage. Several cases of brutal attacks on women in the state have followed.

Akhilesh Yadav's political rivals have demanded the dismissal of his government. The 41-year-old chief minister met top cops and bureaucrats of his state on Tuesday to review law and order in UP.

New Delhi:
A man, awarded a seven-year jail term by a trial court for raping a minor, has been acquitted in the 15-year-old case by the Delhi High Court which held that physical relations between them were consensual.

Setting aside the trial court's decision of convicting and sentencing Bihar resident Rameshwar Giri on charges of kidnap and rape in 2001, a bench headed by Justice Indermeet Kaur said the girl was conscious of her act and it cannot be termed as an act of force.

The court was deciding the appeal filed by Giri against his conviction and sentence. He had claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case due to previous enmity.

""The offence of rape as defined under Section 375 of the IPC (unamended) is not made out as for the purposes of rape to qualify as a minor, the victim should be less than 16 years. As noted supra, the victim was aged 15 years and 9 months on the date of the offence, just about three months short of the age of 16,"" the bench said.

""Being in the age of discretion, this court is of the view that she was conscious of her act in accompanying the accused and it cannot be said to be an act of force. The accused is entitled to an acquittal for the offence under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the IPC. He is accordingly acquitted of the said charge.

""More so, this is not a case where there was any persuasion on the part of the accused which can amount to taking or enticing the victim as is the language contained in Section 361 of the IPC,"" the court said.

The court also acquitted Giri of the charge of kidnapping the girl, saying there was no active persuasion on the part of the accused as it was an invitation extended by him to the girl which was accepted by her.

According to the prosecution, the girl knew Giri prior to the incident as he used to visit her house. On February 2, 1999 when she was standing near a public water tank near her house here, Giri asked her to accompany him for sightseeing and she agreed.

Giri, however, took her to Bihar in a train where he had physical relations with her twice, it said.

When the girl did not return, her parents lodged a missing complaint. She was later on recovered by the police.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court on Monday extended its March 15 interim order staying execution of the death sentence of Mukesh and Pawan Gupta - two of the four convicts in December 16, 2012, Delhi gang rape case - and directed the matter be listed in July's second week for final hearing.

A bench of Justice B.S.Chauhan and Justice J. Chelameswar asked the Delhi government to place before it all the records in the case including that of the trial court along with their English translation.

The apex court on April 7 had asked counsel M.L. Sharma, who is representing Mukesh and Pawan Gupta, to place before it the post-mortem report of the Singapore hospital where victim was treated and succumbed to her injuries.

A bench of Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai and Justice Shiva Kirti Singh at a special sitting on March 15 had stayed the execution of the death sentence of Mukesh and Pawan till March 31.

This was extended by Justice Chauhan and Justice Chelameswar by a week till April 7, again extended and now it stands extended till second week of July.

Mukesh and Pawan have contended that the prosecution's story that the victim's end came because of heavy bleeding on account of serious injuries to her intestines was not confirmed by the post-mortem report by the Singapore hospital.

They have contended that their trial was not free and fair, and the trial that started Jan 21, 2013, was under ""public/political pressure"" with ""object to hang the petitioners (Mukesh and Pawan) and other accused people"".

Describing the entire trial as ""miscarriage of justice"", the petitioners have contended that their fundamental right (under article 21 and 22 of the constitution) to have a counsel of their choice was violated as they were represented by a state-appointed advocate.

On March 13, the Delhi High Court bench of Justice Reva Khetrapal and Justice Pratibha Rani had upheld the death sentence of Mukesh and Pawan along with two other convicts.

""Society's abhorrence to atrocious crimes perpetrated upon innocent and helpless victims has resulted in the death penalty being retained on the statute book to remind such criminals that human life is very precious and one who dares to take the life of others must lose his own life,"" the high court had said in its order.

Mukesh, Pawan, Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur and Ram Singh along with a juvenile were accused of gang-rape and assault on a 23-year-old paramedical student inside a private bus. The victim and her friend were thrown out of the bus after the crime.

The victim died of grave intestinal injuries Dec 29, 2012 at Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital.

Noida:
In yet another incident highlighting the continued apathy towards women, a minor Dalit girl has alleged that the police did not register a case after she was repeatedly gang-raped over four days allegedly by a group of men in a village in Noida near Delhi.

The girl, 14, was attending a wedding in Salarpur village on April 17 when she was abducted allegedly by seven men. When her family approached the police, they allegedly refused to lodge a complaint. The girl, meanwhile, was gang-raped several times allegedly by five men, and was then dumped at a secluded spot on April 20, close to the place from where she had been kidnapped.

When the girl, along with her family, again went to the local police to file a first information report (FIR), the cops allegedly refused again. The cops, in fact, allegedly urged the teen and the family to agree to a compromise with the accused.

A case of rape has now been filed after the matter was brought to the knowledge of senior police officials. The accused, though, are on the run.

New Delhi:
A court in Delhi on Friday granted interim bail, till May 20, to Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Dhananjay Singh, accused in the case of the torture of his domestic help, leading to her death, after turning down Delhi Police's contention that he wanted to campaign for Lok Sabha elections and he was taking undue benefit of father's illness to seek bail.

""Earlier also on one occasion, the accused had been granted one week's interim bail by the Supreme Court to file his nomination papers which was further extended for one more day by the Delhi High Court,"" the court said.

Giving bail to the BSP MP, Additional Sessions Judge Lokesh Kumar Sharma asked him to furnish a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh with one surety of the same amount.

The MP's counsel, N. Hariharan and S.P.M. Tripathi, while requesting the court to release their client on bail, told the court that his father is ill and admitted in a hospital in Lucknow.

The court took into account the note of the verification report regarding the hospitalization and treatment of Dhananjay's father Raj Dev Singh.

""Hence, even if it is presumed that the accused shall also campaign for his own Lok Sabha elections besides looking after his ailing father, then this fact shall not cause any prejudice to the case of the prosecution in any manner and also there shall be no threat to the prosecution witnesses as the accused will not be available in Delhi during this period and will be available only in his Lok Sabha constituency,"" the court said.

Earlier on April 15, another court granted interim bail to the MP in a rape case against him.

Singh, the sitting MP from Uttar Pradesh's Jaunpur, was charge-sheeted on February 1 along with his wife Jagriti for various offences, including destroying evidence and abetting murder and attempt to murder.

He and his wife, who is a dental surgeon in a government hospital in Delhi, were arrested in November 2013.

New Delhi:
A 30-year-old woman was arrested by Delhi Police from Jaipur along with an associate for allegedly extorting money from a Delhi businessman after threatening to trap him in a rape case, police said on Sunday.

The accused identified as Meenakshi, a resident of Bharatpur in Rajasthan, was arrested on Saturday from Jaipur after police laid a trap.

The woman had already taken Rs 5 lakh from the businessman as she had a video purportedly featuring him in a compromising position with her.

But when she demanded Rs 2 crore, the victim decided to approach the police.

""She was called there by the victim on the pretext of giving Rs 40 lakh, as extortion money. A jeweller Arun Kothari was also arrested for helping her. Meenakshi's husband Sandeep managed to flee,"" a police official said.

The 45-year-old businessman approached police in January and filed a case against the woman in Prashant Vihar police station in west Delhi.

""Singh told us that he had established a physical relationship with the woman after they came in contact, but she had allegedly recorded a video of the act with the help of her husband and Manjeet.

""She then threatened to trap him in a rape case and demanded money,"" the official said.

New Delhi:
BSP MP Dhananjay Singh, accused in a rape case, was granted interim bail by a court in Delhi on Tuesday.

Additional Sessions Judge Sarita Birbal granted bail to Dhananjay Singh till May 20, after the complainant in the case withdrew the rape allegation levelled against him.

The court observed that the complainant has not supported the case of the prosecution and she had deposed that Dhananjay Singh had ""neither committed rape on her nor threatened her"".

The trial court has directed the MP from Uttar Pradesh's Jaunpur constituency to furnish a personal bond of Rs 50,000 and a surety of like amount. Directing him not to leave the country without the court's permission, the judge has asked him not to make any attempt to contact any of the prosecution witnesses.

Dhananjay Singh, accused along with his wife in connection with the alleged murder of their domestic help, was granted temporary bail for a week from April 14 to April 21 by the Supreme Court on April 9, so that he could file his nomination papers from Jaunpur Lok Sabha constituency.

The complainant, a married railway employee who had lodged a rape case against the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP, told the court that the accused has done nothing wrong with her and she had deposed against the accused in front of a magistrate under pressure from relatives.

She has said that a case was lodged against the MP as she feared that he was interfering in her matrimonial life. Telling the court that she was disturbed after her husband sent divorce papers to her in 2009, she stressed that nothing wrong was done with her by the accused.

The accused had not committed rape, she said, adding that she does not want to depose against Dhananjay Singh, who faced trial under various charges dealing with rape, voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation.

Dhananjay Singh was charge sheeted on January 31 for allegedly repeatedly raping the woman between July 2005 and March 2009. According to her complaint, the MP allegedly raped her at gunpoint and threatened her with dire consequences if she reported the matter, police said.

Massive protests were organised across the nation after the brutal assault on a physiotherapy student in Delhi on December 16, 2012
New Delhi:
A convict who was 17 when he participated in the heinous and fatal gang-rape of a young woman on a Delhi bus cannot be tried by a regular court, said Supreme Court judges today, rejecting the request of the victim's parents.

Six men were found guilty of the gang-rape that shocked India and ignited huge street protests and a national debate on the lack of safety for women.

The teen  was tried by a special juvenile court last year  and given the maximum sentence of three years in a reform home.  The parents of the woman who died said that punishment was not severe enough, and asked for him to be tried by a regular court, where the death sentence could apply if he were to be found guilty.

In December 2012, a 23-year-old physiotherapy intern boarded a bus with her male companion. Six men then assaulted him and took turns raping her before flinging  the barely conscious couple onto a road. Her injuries were so severe that she died nearly a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

The  public fury over her death impelled the introduction of new laws to punish sexual crimes against women.

Six men were arrested for the gang-rape, including the minor. Of the others, Ram Singh, the alleged ring-leader, was found dead in his prison cell in March last year during his trial by a special fast-track court in Delhi. The other four adult convicts have been sentenced to death.

BJP leader Subramanian Swamy had asked the Supreme Court to consider redefining the legal definition of a juvenile.  He said that when deciding the culpability of a juvenile, the   ""mental and intellectual maturity"" of the accused should be taken into account, rather than the age limit of 18.

New Delhi:
BSP MP Dhananjay Singh was today put on trial by a Delhi court for allegedly raping a 42-year-old woman for nearly four years.

Additional Sessions Judge Sarita Birbal framed charges against Singh under various provisions of the IPC relating to rape, voluntarily causing hurt and criminal intimidation.

The court has fixed April 1 for commencement of trial in the case by recording of statements of prosecution witnesses.

In its charge sheet, police has arraigned 13 persons, including three doctors, as prosecution witnesses.

It also dismissed the bail plea on the grounds that he can influence the witnesses.

Earlier, during arguments on framing of charges against Singh, a sitting MP from Jaunpur constituency in Uttar Pradesh, police had said they had the evidence which showed the involvement of the accused in the crime.

It had said the forensic and medical reports of the victim corroborated the statement given by her before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC.

The police had said the victim has given all the details of the incident in her statement under 164 CrPC.

Senior advocate Hariharan and advocate S P M Tripathi, who appeared for Singh, had said there were inconsistencies and improvement in the statement of the alleged victim and police cannot solely rely on her statement.

The charge sheet was filed against Singh for offences under various penal provisions of the IPC, including 376(2) (h) (rape knowing that a woman is pregnant) and 376 (2) (n) (repeatedly raping the same woman), 377 (unnatural offence), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation).

The complaint was filed against Singh by the woman after the MP and his wife Jagriti Singh, a dental surgeon at a government hospital, were arrested last November in connection with their maid's murder in which a charge sheet was recently filed.

In the charge sheet against Singh in the rape case, police alleged that he had repeatedly raped the woman between July 2005 and March 2009.

Referring to the complaint filed by the woman, police had alleged the victim was raped several times by Singh at gunpoint and was threatened with dire consequences if she reported the matter.

They had also said the husband of the complainant was a businessman and was known to Singh and through him, she had first met the accused in February 2005.

In a press release last night, Delhi's new Law Minister Somnath Bharti, who is a member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), revealed the identity of the Danish woman gang-raped in Delhi, which is against the law:

Deeply aggrieved by the robbing and absolutely inhuman rape of Denmark National Miss (REDACTED) inflicted by nine men in the afternoon of 14.01.2014, Shri Somnath Bharti, Minister of Law & Justice, Tourism, Administrative Reforms and Art & Culture, Govt. of NCT of Delhi discussed first with Delhi Police and then with the Consulate of Denmark Mr. Eric Schott Johann, who seemed more than satisfied with the help extended by Delhi Police to the Victim.

The Consulate further informed that the victim in spite of repeated requests by Delhi Police as well as Consulate himself refused to undergo the medical and also refused to stay here to identify the inhumane rapists and unable to cope with the mental agony she opted to leave for her country by the morning flight today. Prior to leaving, as per the Consulate the victim identified the rapists using the pictures brought by the Police and also helped Police to locate the place of the barbarous incident where the victim's clothing were  also found.

The Consulate also informed Shri Bharti that though the Police was very helpful but security officials at the Airport did not allow the Consulate to accompany beyond the entry gate and unaccompanied victim collapsed at Airport. The sources informed to Bharti that she was duly taken care of following her collapse.

It is a matter of shame that such barbarous incident took place in Delhi. Had law and order been under the control of Delhi Government, more effective measures could have been possible for Delhi Government to make Delhi a safer place for it to become the best tourist destination in India and Asia.

Mr Bharti apologized, through the Consulate, to the victim and her family and further vows that he will do everything within the means of Delhi Government to plug the holes for providing secure and safe environment for Delhites and especially for women in Delhi. Fast track courts for dealing with rape cases is already figuring among the top most priorities of Delhi Govt.

The woman had approached the group for directions near the New Delhi Railway Station.
New Delhi:
A Danish woman was allegedly gang-raped in Delhi late last night, the latest high-profile case of sexual assault in the country. The 51-year-old woman was allegedly attacked by a gang of eight men after losing her way to her hotel in Paharganj, a popular backpacker area.

All eight men have been identified but have not been found, said police sources to NDTV.

The woman has told the police she was held by the men between 4 and 7 pm after which they abandoned her. She then took an auto-rickshaw to her hotel where she confided in a fellow tourist, who asked the owner to phone the police. She says she was robbed and beaten too.

""When she came, she was crying and not in good shape,"" said the hotel owner.

The woman had approached the group for directions near the New Delhi Railway Station after visiting a museum, but they took her to a secluded spot before raping her.

The woman arrived in Delhi on Tuesday after visiting the Taj Mahal in Agra. This morning, she took a flight back to Denmark.

The case comes weeks after a Polish woman was allegedly drugged and raped by a taxi driver while traveling with her two-year-old daughter to New Delhi.

The incident has left Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on the backfoot weeks after it won massive popular support in state polls with its promise to make the city safer for women.

""Ask the central home minister. Delhi Police is under the Centre, not the state government, and it is unable to function effectively,"" said AAP's Kumar Vishwas, falling back on the same argument that the party had attacked Sheila Dikshit's Congress government for last year .

Last month marked the first anniversary of the death of a student who was gang-raped on a moving Delhi bus in an attack that horrified India and triggered massive protests that led to sweeping changes in laws on crimes against women. (Candle-light vigils as Delhi's braveheart remembered)

The woman had approached the group for directions near the New Delhi Railway Station after visiting amuseum, but they took her to a secluded spot before raping her.

The Delhi government headed by Arvind Kejriwal has not commented so far on the case.

The woman arrived in Delhi on Tuesday after visiting the Taj Mahal in Agra.

The case comes weeks after a Polish woman was allegedly drugged and raped by a taxi driver while travelling with her two-year-old daughter to New Delhi.

Last month marked the first anniversary of the death of a student who was gang-raped on a moving Delhi bus in an attack that horrified India. (Candle-light vigils as Delhi's braveheart remembered)

The gang-rape triggered massive protests over the levels of violence against women, but in the last 12 months reported cases of local and foreign women being attacked have shot up significantly.

Six men were sentenced to life in prison last July for the gang-rape and robbery of a 39-year-old Swiss woman cyclist who had been holidaying in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.

New Delhi:
Judges should not make ""gender biased"" and ""insensitive"" comments in their verdicts while dealing with cases pertaining to women, the Delhi High Court said while expunging two such remarks made by a fast track court.

Taking suo motu cognisance of the remarks made by the court's trial judge while giving verdict in a rape case, a bench of justices Pradeep Nandrajog and V Kameswar Rao said the observations are ""prima-facie insensitive"".

The bench further said that the ""sweeping observations"" against the girl are ""not based on the evidence on record"".

""It is apparent that the remarks, which are general in nature, are not based on the evidence on record, appear to be the result of the experience of the judge... The judge has imparted his personal knowledge pertaining to females in the decision making,"" the bench said.

Referring to the judge's comment that women in the age group of 19-24 years voluntarily elope with their lovers, the bench said the remark is ""not based on any empirical data"". ""The passage brings out the dilemma of the women in the Indian society. Caught between her ambition to choose a life partner and the pull of the patriarchal society, women are torn apart between her personal ambition and the patriarchal society. So placed, she has to be treated with sympathy and care and not made the object of ridicule by styling her as a person who is in conflict with herself,"" the bench said.

Referring to another observation made by the judge, the bench said, ""The second observation is a sermon as to how girls should conduct themselves in society"". ""Every individual is entitled to choose the social life which one wants to lead, and if in the process of choosing the social life which one wants to lead, somebody causes harm, no court can say that: You chose a way of life at your peril and thus the system will not hear your cry,"" it added.

""The observations by the judge are prima-facie insensitive observations and are capable of influencing the police to take up women harassment cases lightly, resulting in an insensitive investigation and complete evidence not being brought before the court,"" the bench observed.

Taking on record the administrative action against the judge by the Delhi High Court, it said, ""Judicial pronouncements which are gender biased may be used as a standard by the police personnel and prosecutors in making decisions how they should investigate and prosecute cases.""

The trial judge in October had made general remarks while dealing with a case filed by a girl against a man, alleging that he had physical relations with her on the false pretext of marriage.

New Delhi:
The mastermind of the 'honey trap' gang that used to extort money from people by trapping them in false rape cases, has been arrested, police said on Friday.

Jitender, 28, was arrested on Wednesday from Mangolpuri in west Delhi.

A total of seven people, including two Delhi police constables Manoj and Pawan, along with three pimps - Neeraj, Vijay and Sunny - and two women have been arrested in the case so far.

Manoj was posted in the Mangolpuri police station while Pawan was working with the Crime Branch.

Jitender, under cover of being a police informer, started committing 'honey trap' crimes with his associates to earn quick and easy money.

""He was running an extortion racket by luring innocent clients in his trap by using beautiful girls,"" said Additional Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch), Ravindra Yadav.

A case was registered in August this year at the Crime Branch police station on an extortion complaint of Rs 3 lakh against some police personnel.

The victim was lured by a woman and her co-associate in Rani Bagh in west Delhi.

""The accused posing themselves as Crime Branch officials detained the victim for several hours in a false rape charge and beat him up,"" said the officer.

They demanded Rs 6 lakh from him and succeeded in fleecing him of Rs 3 lakh following negotiations.

Yadav said a woman gang member would take a client to their place and no sooner were they in a compromising position, then other gang members posing as Crime Branch officials would barge in and catch the customer.

""They pretended to arrest the client on rape charges. Once he came under pressure, they demanded a huge sum of money for not taking legal action,"" said Yadav.

A year since Delhi rape, women see key changes

In this Dec. 2, 2013 photo, a staff member enters information after a call by a distressed woman on a government hotline established in the wake of last year's gang rape and murder of a young woman, in New Delhi, India.
New Delhi:
The phones were ringing nonstop in the tiny, windowless office in downtown New Delhi, with urgent appeals from desperate women.

One caller, speaking in whispers, said her husband beat her regularly because she failed to bring in enough dowry. Another woman said her teenage daughter was being stalked by a neighbour and needed legal advice.

Established in the wake of last year's gang rape and murder of a young New Delhi woman, the government hotline is part of a wave of change since the case forced the country to confront its appalling treatment of women.

The victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, was heading home with a male friend after an evening showing of the movie ""Life of Pi"" when six men lured them onto a private bus. With no one else in sight, they beat the man with a metal bar, raped the woman and used the bar to inflict massive internal injuries.

The pair was dumped naked on the roadside, and the woman died two weeks later.

Indian media named her ""Nirbhaya,"" or ""fearless,"" as rape victims cannot be identified under Indian law. She became a rallying cry for tens of thousands protesting the treatment of women.

New laws have made stalking, voyeurism and sexual harassment a crime. There is now a fast-track court for rape cases. In some ways, the case cracked a cultural taboo surrounding discussion of sexual violence in a country where rape is often viewed as a woman's personal shame to bear.

But for so many women in India's urban centers like New Delhi and Mumbai, the new laws have not made the streets any safer. And in such a conservative country with patriarchal traditions, it will take more than a year to erode generations of devastating sexism.

""Out on the streets, I find men staring at me, passing lewd comments,"" said Barnali Barman, a 23-year-old business executive in New Delhi. ""I find people following me as I get down from the train and walk to my office.""

Nirbhaya's father told The Associated Press he takes comfort in the changes his daughter's suffering have brought.

But, he said, ""not a day passes when we don't shed tears.""

""Our tears are not for her death, but for what she suffered,"" he said in an interview from the family's three-room apartment in the outer suburbs of New Delhi.

""We just can't forget how she suffered at the hands of these men,"" he added, his voice thickening. On the wall hung a faded piece of cloth - an award for bravery given posthumously to his daughter.

His wife, a pale shadow, backs out of the room at any mention of her daughter.

The assailants were tried relatively quickly in a country where sexual assault cases often languish for years. Four defendants were sentenced to death. Another hanged himself in prison, though his family insists he was killed. And an 18-year-old who was a juvenile at the time of the attack was sentenced to three years in a reform home.

In India, the arrival of a daughter is a tragic event in many families. Illegal sex-selective abortions over decades have left the country with a ratio of 914 girls under age 6 for every 1,000 boys. Girls get less medical care and less education.

Still, in the last two decades as the Indian economy boomed, rising education levels and inflation have led to larger numbers of women joining the work force. But the deep-rooted social attitudes toward women have remained largely unchanged.

The result is that women's complaints of rape and sexual abuse remain drastically underreported. Families often do not make a police complaint to avoid the stigma that befalls the victim and her family.

""The criminals know that the Indian police and courts will take 10 years or more to prosecute them,"" said Tanpreet Singh, a 26-year-old New Delhi businessman. ""The system is corrupt and many succeed in bribing their way out.""

For all the attention given to Nirbhaya's case, daily indignities and abuse continue unabated for many women, particularly the poor.

""Indian society has to change its mindset about women,"" said Chaitali, a field worker with Jagori, a women's rights group, who goes by one name. ""That is something that will take more than a year. If we are lucky it will take a couple of generations.""

The women's hotline aims to speed things up. On a recent evening, six women wearing headsets sat at computer terminals, speaking in gentle tones to agitated callers.

""Most of the calls are from women who are suffering some kind of abuse - sexual harassment, domestic violence, stalking, or obscene phone calls,"" said Khadijah Faruqui, a veteran women's rights activist who heads the helpline project.

In cases of domestic violence, or where there is imminent danger to the caller's life, the helpline informs the police, or women's groups nearby, so that they can reach the scene and intervene. The helpline also offers legal advice and follow-up calls.

In a little less than a year, the helpline has handled more than half a million distress calls from women in trouble, Faruqui said.

Activists say one outcome of the public debate is that women are coming forward to register complaints against sexual abuse.

There has been a surge in the number of rapes being reported: Between January and October this year, there have been 1,330 rapes reported in Delhi and its suburbs, compared with the 706 for the whole of 2012, according to government figures.

Several recent, high-profile cases also suggest women feel more comfortable going public with reports of sexual assaults - an important breakthrough in a country where men feel emboldened to commit crimes because they know women face the stigma.

Last month, the high-profile editor of an Indian magazine known for exposing abuses of power was arrested after a young female colleague accused him of sexually assaulting her in a hotel elevator during a conference.

The allegations against Tehelka Editor Tarun Tejpal have touched a nerve in part because he is the face of a publication that has pushed Indian society to vanquish corruption and confront the scourge of sexual violence.

Women's rights also took on unprecedented significance in India's state elections last week, with the three main parties adopting a ""womanifesto"" - a list of six priority actions to protect the freedom and safety of women in the capital.

""Today, every political party is promising safety and security as the first commitment to women in the country,"" said Ranjana Kumari, a women's rights activist with New Delhi's Centre for Social Research. ""This was something which they never thought was necessary.""

Kumari said there are glimmers of hope as women become aware that they no longer have to put up with sexual harassment.

""Instead of a fearful silence,"" she said, ""there is openness without the inhibitions of social shame.""

Tehelka case: it is rape, call it that

Mihira Sood has been litigating in Delhi for the past six years and is currently pursuing her LLM at Columbia Law School.
Mihira Sood has been litigating in Delhi for the past six years and is currently pursuing her LLM at Columbia Law School. 

Last month, she wrote this column on how she - and many other young women -are exposed to sexual harassment in ""one of India's most sexist professions."" 

Here, her take on the Tehelka rape case.

The Tehelka rape case raises some crucial issues, which one hopes will be discussed in greater depth now that the drama around Tarun Tejpal's arrest has subsided.

To start with, the issue of what to call it. There seems to be a universal reluctance to call it a rape case - instead it is referred to as the Tehelka controversy, sexual harassment, sex scandal, sexual assault, and perhaps someone will say it is ""assault that falls within the legal definition of rape"" but no one is calling it rape.

This is not pre-judging an issue before it has been tried, it is only characterising what kind of trial it is.

It is true that the complainant had herself referred to it as harassment in her initial communications, but she is not a lawyer and the fact that she may not have known what legal provisions apply to her case cannot be held against her.

Even the most ardent supporters of the new law have shied away from calling it rape in media discussions. Perhaps the law has ingrained in us so deeply that there is only one kind of act that is rape, that people are taking some time to digest the reality that the law has changed.

What further seems to have happened here is that though this is a case of rape, the initial mis-characterisation of it as sexual harassment served to add to the already ongoing debate on sexual harassment and was thus taken up in that vein by an enthusiastic media, creating a very confused discourse. While I applaud the media for its zealous coverage of sexual violence cases, I do feel that the rush to conflate all these issues has damaged both the complainant's case here as well as that of sexual harassment victims, whose violations are seen as comparatively less offensive and certainly less sensational.

Sexual harassment is an offence under the IPC, and sexual harassment at the workplace is dealt with in a separate law, though the definition is the same. Therefore, workplace harassment is covered under both laws and the complainant has a choice of seeking criminal punishment or having it dealt with at the organizational level.

When it comes to rape, the victim has a choice of whether or not to press a complaint, but a complaint may still be filed by a third person, though it will certainly be weakened without her testimony.

The new law of rape doesn't just cover digital penetration, but also provides an enhanced punishment (minimum ten years) where the rape is by a person in a position of authority towards the complainant. Not only that, Section 376 C states that a person who abuses a position of authority to induce a woman to have sexual intercourse with him (which includes the acts alleged against Mr. Tejpal) will be liable to 5-10 years in prison even where rape is not proved. In other words, his argument that she was a willing party is irrelevant in the face of her accusation.The provision provides a presumption that sexual intercourse between a superior and a subordinate is non-consensual once a woman has complained.

Therefore, the attempts at indicating consent or character assassination by Tejpal and his lawyers are not only nauseating, but also are of no help to him under the new laws.

So while the Tehelka case and other disclosures about harassment made in recent times have the common thread of powerful employers sexually exploiting their juniors, but there is a big difference in how the law treats workplace harassment and workplace rape, and a big difference in what an employer is obliged to do in each situation.

Both the Tehelka case and the Supreme Court harassment case are the first of their kind in many respects and it is not surprising that they have both been dealt with in such a confused manner. The journalist's case was treated as a sexual harassment case, the committee hearing the law intern's case is not even in compliance with Vishakha guidelines, the list of errors is long.

Shoma Chaudhury has certainly failed as an employer who thought she was dealing with a sexual harassment complaint, but this is a rape case, there needs to be greater focus on the accused, which she is not.Neither she nor Tehelka deserve to bear the brunt of the rank political opportunism by parties who have never cared for gender equality.

New Delhi:
Tehelka founder Tarun Tejpal, accused of raping a younger colleague in Goa earlier this month, faxed a letter to the Goa Police yesterday evening saying he will make himself available for interrogation after lunch today. (Read full text of Tarun Tejpal's letter to the police)

The Goa Police has meanwhile moved a sessions court seeking a non-bailable arrest warrant against Mr Tejpal. An order is expected this morning. The police have said Mr Tejpal's arrest is imminent as he failed to meet a 3 pm deadline set by them to appear for interrogation yesterday.

Mr Tejpal's lawyers will also be in a Goa court today morning to try and get bail and pre-empt his arrest. He withdrew his request for bail from the Delhi High Court yesterday to be able to seek bail in Goa.

The senior journalist had earlier told the Goa Police that he would meet them on Saturday afternoon. He said that the police order asking him to travel to Goa was received late at night. ""Since I am not a resident of Goa, I require a little time to appear before you,"" he said.

The Goa Police rejected his request for an extension of deadline.

Mr Tejpal has denied the charges of rape against him, and said that the encounter that's being described as rape was ""light hearted bantering."" (Only ""light-hearted bantering"" not sexual assault: Tarun Tejpal)

The young journalist who has accused him of sexual assault has ardently challenged his version of events, and accused Tehelka and her boss, Shoma Chaudhury, of trying to engineer a cover-up. She quit Tehelka earlier this week. (Tehelka journalist who accused founder of sexual assault resigns)

Ms Chaudhury also resigned yesterday from Tehelka after days of being pelted with criticism for her handling of the reporter's complaint, sent to her via an email that was leaked. (Full text: resignation letter sent by woman journalist to Tehelka)

That email was used by the Goa Police to file an FIR against Mr Tejpal.

New Delhi:
The Goa Police has said it cannot offer Tehelka founder Tarun Tejpal the extension he had sought to make himself available for interrogation, ""given the gravity of the offence"".

Deputy Inspector General OP Misra also said they ""will act as per the law now...without loss of time."" He said the next logical step had been initiated, alluding to the possible arrest of Mr Tejpal.

The senior journalist, accused of raping a younger colleague in Goa earlier this month, had written to the Goa Police to say he could not comply with its deadline of 3 pm today for his interrogation because he was not given enough notice. He said he would make himself available on Saturday afternoon.

He has also withdrawn his request for anticipatory bail from the Delhi High Court, which had said it would announce its decision tomorrow. Mr Tejpal's lawyers plan to instead ask for bail in a court in Goa.

""I assure you of my complete and full cooperation,"" the 50-year-old wrote in his note to the police today.

The Goa Police has charged Mr Tejpal with raping a woman reporter at a Tehelka event at a five-star hotel in the state.

Mr Tejpal has said that the encounter that's being described as rape was ""light hearted bantering.""

Panaji:
The woman journalist who was allegedly raped by Tehelka founder Tarun Tejpal recorded her statement for a magistrate in Goa today. This version of events will be used in court to substantiate the Goa Police's case against Mr Tejpal, who has said he is being framed.

Mr Tejpal's request for pre-trial or anticipatory bail will be heard by the Delhi High Court today.

The reporter has said that Mr Tejpal sexually assaulted her twice at an annual Tehelka conference at a five-star hotel in Goa earlier this month. In his request for bail, Mr Tejpal, who is 50, has said she is misrepresenting ""light hearted bantering."" However, in an email to the reporter sent just days ago, he offered a starkly different version of events, acknowledging that he attempted ""a sexual liaison with you on two occasions... despite your clear reluctance.""

The journalist quit Tehelka on Monday accusing managing editor Shoma Chaudhury of orchestrating a cover-up in which doubts were being raised about her account.

Ms Chaudhury today denied it saying, ""I strongly reject the allegations that I am involved in any manner with any slander, intimidation or character assassination of the journalist. This is a malicious campaign that has no basis in truth.""

The Goa Police has ordered Mr Tejpal to make himself available for interrogation as soon as possible.

Airports have been alerted to stop Mr Tejpal from leaving the country.

The journalist who he allegedly violated did not press charges. She detailed her complaint to Shoma Chaudhury in an email that was leaked and became the inception point for the Goa Police's investigation.

""She was shattered, I told her she needs to come out and the tell police, she is a brave girl,"" said the journalist's legal adviser Shyam Keswani.

Mr Tejpal has claimed that the ruling BJP in Goa is using the case to get even with him for Tehelka's earlier exposes on some of its top leaders.

New Delhi:
Tarun Tejpal, the founder of Tehelka magazine who has been accused  of raping a junior colleague in Goa earlier this month, has applied for anticipatory bail in the Delhi High Court.

His case will be heard tomorrow.

Over the weekend, the Goa Police recorded the testimony of three Tehelka employees in whom the young journalist had confided. (Read)

Mr Tejpal has not been questioned yet; nor has the young journalist, who lives in Mumbai.

Over the weekend she  expressed fears of intimidation and harassment  -she said that a member of Mr Tejpal's immediate family had visited her mother in in Delhi and asked what the journalist ""wanted"". (Read: 'I fear intimidation, harassment', says journalist)

Mr Tejpal, 50, has offered  contradicting versions of what happened at his magazine's annual and high-profile conference in Goa.  In an apology emailed to the young woman last week, he wrote, ""I apologize unconditionally for the shameful lapse of judgement that led me to attempt a sexual liaison with you on two occasions....despite your clear reluctance that you did not want such attention from me."" (Full text of Tarun Tejpal's email to young journalist)

But after the Goa Police filed an FIR against him for rape, he said on Friday that the encounter had been consensual. (Read: After Tarun Tejpal's email, signs of cover-up)

The journalist has not pressed charges but has said she will cooperate with the investigation.

She reported the alleged sexual assault first to Tehelka Managing Editor Shoma Chaudhury in a lengthy email, which was leaked. It is on the basis of this note that the Goa Police commenced the investigation against Mr Tejpal. 

Ms Chaudhury's own role in the controversy is under intense scrutiny since experts say she broke the law by failing to report the matter to the police though the journalist clearly alleged sexual assault in her email. (Watch: 'Not my place to go to the police,' says Tehelka's Shoma Chaudhury)

Ms Chaudhary instead wrote to Tehelka employees informing them that Mr Tejpal had decided to take six months off.

Over the weekend, she was interrogated in Delhi by the Goa Police in a video-taped session that lasted several hours.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde during the All India Conference of DGPs / IGPs at Vigyan Bhavan in New Delhi.
New Delhi:
Against the backdrop of rape and other crimes, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today favoured putting in place institutional mechanisms to ensure safety and security of women and children.

Addressing a conference of top police brass of the country, Dr Singh said the tragic rape and murder of a young girl in Delhi last December not only brought into sharp focus the issue of women's safety but also the rising expectations of the people from the police in preventing such crimes.

""We have recently enacted several laws providing stringent punishment for such crimes and more sensitive treatment of victims during investigation and trial.

""We also need to put in place other institutional mechanisms to ensure the safety and security of women and children. I expect the DGPs of states to show leadership in this area,"" he said.

The Prime Minister, however, did not elaborate what the institutional mechanism would be.

The comments come in the midst of the raging controversy over the alleged sexual assault on a woman colleague by Tehelka founder Tarun Tejpal.

After the December 16 incident, the government had amended various provisions of law and strengthened those related to crime against women and children.

New Delhi:
Shoma Chaudhury, the Managing Editor of Tehelka, today said that despite the criticism hurled at her, she does not believe she should have alerted the police to a complaint of sexual assault against the founder of the news magazine, Tarun Tejpal. He was charged with rape by the Goa police in an FIR filed today.

""I still believe it was not my place to go to the police,"" she told NDTV today, adding that her opinion had been corroborated by legal experts and women activists who she has consulted.  

The Goa police has charged Mr Tejpal, 50, with rape in an FIR today. Earlier this week, he said he was stepping down as editor-in-chief for six months as ""penance"" for ""a bad lapse of judgment.""

Ms Chaudhury said that though Mr Tejpal ""had a completely different version of the incident, but because I was driven by my allegiance to women's rights, I completely over rode his version and asked for an unconditional apology because I felt that regardless of  the different version, he had transgressed as the leader of the institution.""  (Readher statement)| (Watch: ""I see why Tarun's email to me sounds like act of vanity"")

When asked why she accepted his temporary removal from office rather than pushing for his resignation, Ms Chaudhury told NDTV that her actions were guided at least in part by how Mr Tejpal's exit could financially impact the organization and the jobs of her employees.

Both Mr Tejpal and the journalist will have the opportunity to present their accounts to a committee created by Tehelka to investigate the controversy, Ms Chaudhury said.

""I am proud that she spoke up, I don't want to be seen in opposition to her,"" Ms Chaudhury told NDTV today, ""but now that it is a criminal case, both sides should be heard."" (Tehelka case: FIR charges Tarun Tejpal with rape)

New Delhi:
Tarun Tejpal, the founder of Tehelka, has been charged with rape in an FIR by the Goa police, which says a team will travel to Delhi to arrest him. A young woman journalist has said he sexually assaulted her on two days at a Tehelka event in Goa earlier this month. Mr Tejpal has also been charged with outraging a woman's modesty and rape by someone who had dominance and authority over the woman, which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a minimum 10 years in jail.
Here are the 10 big developments in this story
Mr Tejpal in a statement today said that he will cooperate with the investigation.
He said he wants the police ""to obtain, examine and release the CCTV footage so that the accurate version of events stands clearly revealed. ""(Urge police to release CCTV footage, says Tarun Tejpal)
The Goa police says it has gone through the footage from the security cameras at the five-star hotel where the alleged assault took place.
Shoma Chaudhury, the Managing Editor of Tehelka, said that Mr Tejpal's version of events is different from what the journalist has offered, and that a committee created at the news-magazine will examine both accounts.
Ms Chaudhury said that despite the differing accounts, she asked Mr Tejpal to issue an unconditional apology to the young journalist.
Speaking to NDTV today, Ms Chaudhury said ""I do not believe it is my place to go the police.""  Activists and legal experts have questioned why neither she nor Mr Tejpal reported the complaint to the police, given the gravity of the allegations. (Watch: Not my place to go to police, Tehelka's Shoma Chaudhury tells NDTV)
Ms Chaudhury also said that her actions were guided partly by concerns like the financial future of the organization and whether the controversy could cost people their jobs.
The Union Home Ministry has asked the Goa government for a report on what it has uncovered so far.
The journalist has not filed a police case. She made her complaint in an email sent on Monday to Ms Chaudhury.
BJP leader Arun Jaitley has accused Mr Tejpal and Ms Chaudhury of striking ""a private treaty"" in what he described as an attempt to suppress ""a clear case of rape.""

The police had said the MP and Jagriti allegedly used to ""mercilessly"" beat and torture their three domestic helps--Rakhi, Meena and a minor.
New Delhi:
Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MP Dhananjay Singh, who is in jail with his wife in connection with the murder of their domestic help, was today remanded in one-day police custody by a Delhi court in another case of rape and criminal intimidation lodged against him.

Dhananjay, a MP from Jaunpur constituency in Uttar Pradesh, was produced before Metropolitan Magistrate Babita Puniya on a production warrant issued against him in a case of allegedly repeatedly raping a 42-year-old woman, a railway employee, between 2005-09.

The Delhi Police arrested Dhananjay inside the courtroom in the fresh case and sought his two-day custody for his interrogation saying the MP is not cooperating with them in the investigation of the case.

Advocate SPM Tripathi, appearing for Dhananjay, opposed the police plea saying his client is cooperating in the probe and he has nothing more to tell the investigators.

The court, however, allowed the police plea and remanded Dhananjay to a day's police custody till tomorrow.

The police said that an FIR of rape was lodged against Dhananjay after the woman recently approached them alleging that she was sexually exploited by him.

She was continuously raped by Dhananjay at gunpoint and was threatened with dire consequences if she reported the matter, the police said.

The rape case was lodged against the MP on November 13 at Pandav Nagar police station in east Delhi.

Dhananjay, whose bail application was yesterday rejected by another court in Delhi, and his wife Jagriti, a dental surgeon at the R M L Hospital, were arrested on November 5 and are currently in judicial custody in connection with the death of their 35-year-old domestic help Rakhi Bhadra, a resident of West Bengal.

The court had rejected Dhananjay's bail in the murder case saying the allegations against him were ""very serious"" and he does not deserve any leniency due his previous conduct.

Rakhi's body, with injury marks on her legs, chest and arms, was recovered from Dhananjay's South Avenue residence on the evening of November 4.

The police had said the MP and Jagriti allegedly used to ""mercilessly"" beat and torture their three domestic helps--Rakhi, Meena and a minor.

The minor domestic help had earlier showed to the court his severe injuries allegedly inflicted by Jagriti.

Police had said the domestic helps were allegedly tortured and thrashed by Jagriti with sticks, iron rods, clothes iron and even metallic deer horns.

Dhananjay, who also faces charges of murder and offences under the UP Gangsters Act, was arrested for allegedly destroying evidence, not informing police about Rakhi's death immediately and employing a juvenile as domestic help.

Jagriti has been arrested under sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 344 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal code and Juvenile Justice Act.

Indian protestors sit by lighted candles as they hold a protest against the gangrape of a student in New Delhi (AFP)
New Delhi:
A court in New Delhi has begun hearing appeal arguments over the death penalty given to four men for the fatal gang-rape of a young student that shocked the nation.

Defence counsel AP Singh said today that the High Court in New Delhi will hear the arguments on a daily basis before deciding on the appeals filed by the men, sentenced to death by a trial court in September.

""The court started hearing the arguments on Friday. We are hoping for a fair ruling. We are keeping our fingers crossed,"" Mr Singh said.

The trial court issued the death sentences on September 13 for the brutal gang-rape of the physiotherapy student on a bus last December. The woman died of her injuries nearly a fortnight later in a Singapore hospital.

The court said that the crime fell into the judicial system's ""rarest of rare category"" that allows capital punishment.

All the four convicts filed appeals in the High Court, seeking to overturn the verdict.
There has been a huge public clamour for the men to be executed for the attack on the woman on December 16.

The murder stirred widespread soul-searching over rampant sexual crime in the country, and resulted in tougher laws to punish rapists.

The convicts are being held at the capital's high-security Tihar Jail.

The fifth suspect in the case, bus driver Ram Singh, died in prison in March in an apparent suicide.

A sixth member of the group, who was a minor at the time of the assault, was sentenced to three years in a reformatory, the maximum penalty allowed under the country's juvenile laws.

India had an unofficial eight-year moratorium on capital punishment until last November, when the only surviving gunman from the 2008 Mumbai militant attacks was executed.

The fifth and last accused in the July 31 telephone operator gang-rape case was today arrested from the city, police said.

""Acting on a tip-off, a trap was laid at Girgaon Chowpatty and the accused, Mohammed Ashfaque Sheikh, was arrested,"" a crime branch officer said.

The 18-year-old telephone operator was allegedly gang-raped at the deserted Shakti Mills compound in Mahalaxmi on July 31 by five men, three of who were also involved in the August 22 photojournalist gang-rape case, the police said.

The three accused involved in both the cases are Salim Ansari, Vijay Jadhav, Mohammed Qasim alias 'Qasim Bangali', who are currently in jail.

The fourth accused, who is a minor, has already been arrested in this (July 31) case and lodged in juvenile remand home in south Mumbai's Dongri area.

On the evening of August 22, a photojournalist was gang-raped at the Shakti Mills compound, when she had gone there on an assignment with a male colleague. The police nabbed all five accused in the case within three days.

On September 3, another gang-rape victim surfaced, after the 18-year-old complained to the police that she too had been gang-raped by a group of five on the mill premises on July 31.

The December 16 gang-rape triggered massive protests across the country
New Delhi:
All four convicts in the gang-rape and murder case of a 23-year-old medical student have been given the death sentence. Bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta, and unemployed Mukesh Singh were found guilty on 13 counts that included rape, murder and destruction of evidence on Tuesday.

All four of them lived in or around an unauthorised slum in the south of the city favoured by hundreds of labourers, most of them migrant workers.

Ram Singh, the regular driver of the bus used for the attack, was found hanging in his prison cell in maximum-security Tihar Jail in March. The 32-year-old had confessed privately to his role, according to his parents, but during the trial he had denied the long list of charges including murder, rape and kidnapping.

Here are profiles of the four men who have been given the death sentence:

MUKESH SINGH

The brother of Ram Singh who migrated to New Delhi from Rajasthan. He frequently worked with his brother on the bus and also tried getting a job with a construction company in Delhi.

During court proceedings in April, the unmarried labourer, who has a tattoo of two swords signifying ""bravery"" on his left arm, told news agency AFP he was a ""very hard working man"" and wanted to ""lead a simple life"".

Aged 29 at the time of the crime, he denied the charges against him and told the court that he ""respected women"".

VINAY SHARMA

Aged 20 at the time of the crime, he denied being on the bus. He worked as a helper at a local gym and lived in the same neighbourhood as Mukesh and Ram Singh.

He had completed his schooling, unlike the other convicts who are school dropouts, and during the trial said he wanted to appear for a recruitment test for a job with the Indian Air Force.

Sharma submitted an application to the judge to be moved out of Tihar jail after being assaulted by inmates. He suffered a fractured left hand while in custody.

PAWAN GUPTA

The youngest of the rapists, aged 19, 
Gupta was a fruitseller who also worked as labourer on roads and construction sites. During wedding season, he would work with a catering company.

He was arrested at the Ram Dass Camp where he lived with his cousin and was known as a friend of Ram Singh.



AKSHAY THAKUR


A married father of a two-year-old son, Thakur also worked as a helper with Ram Singh and had earlier been employed in a local liquor factory and in a brick kiln

Aged 28 at the time of the crime, he fled from Delhi on December 17, but was arrested at his father-in-law's home in the eastern state of Bihar.

His wife, Punita Devi, told the police, that if her husband is found guilty then he should be ""shot dead"".

The Delhi gang-rape case ignited massive protests in December last year and forced the introduction of tougher laws to punish sexual offences
New Delhi:
The much-awaited closure in a case that triggered nationwide protests and soul-searching about the treatment of women in India may happen today with a Delhi fast-track court set to announce the quantum of punishment for the gang-rape and murder of a young student last December.

Judge Yogesh Khanna will decide whether the crime of the four convicts, pronounced guilty on Tuesday under 13 charges including rape and murder, falls in the 'rarest of the rare' category, warranting death sentence. (Delhi gang-rape verdict: 4 convicted for rape & murder in case that shook India)

Bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, gym instructor Vinay Sharma, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta and unemployed Mukesh Singh lured the woman and her male friend onto the off-duty school bus on the night of December 16, 2012, as the couple returned home after watching a movie at a mall.

They beat the man and, after gang-raping the young student for 45 minutes in the moving bus, they threw the couple, naked and semi-conscious, on the road. She died in a Singapore hospital on December 29.

The barbarous attack tore into India, introducing street protests, new laws for sex offences, and a national debate on the safety of women.

Six men were arrested. One killed himself in his prison cell in March. Another, who was 17 at the time of the attack, was sentenced by a juvenile court last month to three years in a reform home. (Juvenile found guilty of rape and murder, gets less than three years in reform home)

In his verdict delivered after a nine-month trial, Judge Khanna said the men had murdered ""a helpless victim"" inflicting 18 internal injuries on her, caused by an iron rod that was used to beat her male friend and then violate her. (Delhi gang-rape: They committed the murder of a helpless victim, says judge)

The girl's parents want the four hanged. ""They have shown no remorse. She wanted them to be set on fire,"" said her mother. (Delhi gang-rape case verdict: I want to live, she told her mother)
 
Defence lawyers, arguing that death penalty does not guarantee a crime-free society, have pleaded for mercy.

""I was appalled by their arguments. Would they say the same had this happened to their own daughter?"" the girl's father had asked.

New Delhi:
The national capital has 1,121 rape cases registered in the first eight months of this year, the highest in the last 13 years.

The number of reported cases which stands at 1,121, till August 31 this year, is more than double than last year's figure of 468 in the same period.

However, Delhi Police see this rise in the number of cases as a good sign, saying that more cases are now being reported and a number of efforts have been taken to ensure women safety in the city after the December 16 gang-rape case last year.

According to National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) data, the numbers of registered rape cases were 572 in 2011, while 507 rape cases were reported in 2010.

A senior police official said, ""Today, complaints are recorded verbatim and FIRs are filed simply on the basis of the women's complaint without raising any issue. This has caused significant rise in the number of registered cases but we are not deterred by it.""

He also claimed that among all the cases of crime against women registered by Delhi Police, more than 80 per cent of the perpetrators are arrested within the first week.

""We have set up a special women's cell to address crime against women. But above all, we need to sensitise the society,"" the official said.

""Surveys reveal that in most cases, the attackers are known to the victim, which is the biggest deterrent for a woman to report such cases. So if the number of reported rape cases is increasing, it means that the efforts have started to yield fruits,"" the official said.

Accused brought to Saket district court in a police van
New Delhi:
Prosecutors sought the death sentence on Wednesday for four men convicted of the gang rape and murder of a student on a bus in Delhi in December, saying the ""diabolical"" crime had shocked the country's conscience.

Judge Yogesh Khanna heard arguments in a fast-track court today. On Friday, he will decide how to punish the men who were found guilty of ""cold-blooded murder"" on Tuesday. He convicted the men on 11 charges including gang rape, murder, theft and ""unnatural offences"". (Read: 'Innocent!' shouted rapists, sentence on Friday)  

""The test is 'was the collective conscience shocked?'. There can be no better example than this case,"" special public prosecutor Dayan Krishnan told the packed court.  He said, ""They showed no mercy even when she prayed for mercy. There should be no mercy for merciless convicts""

The 23-year-old victim, a physiotherapy student who cannot be named for legal reasons, died of grievous internal injuries on December 29.

Her case served as a brutal call-to-action for a country long inured to sexual violence against women; thousands marched in the streets demanding change.  (Full coverage)

The student had been lured on to the private bus with a male friend after they left a South Delhi mall.  After beating up the friend, the gang brutally assaulted her behind tinted windows for 45 minutes before flinging the bloodied, naked and barely conscious couple from the vehicle on a road leading to the international airport.

The four convicts -- Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh -- were led into the court by armed police and stood at the back of the court wearing t-shirts. (Read: The men found guilty)

The mother of the girl they killed could be seen seated next to her husband as she listened intently to proceedings while dressed in a green sari.

The Delhi gang-rape case ignited massive protests in December last year and forced the introduction of tougher laws to punish sexual offences
New Delhi:
""I want to live,"" the young woman told her mother in a Delhi hospital. Outside, on the streets, thousands marched, demanding justice for her and a safer country for women than the one where a student could be raped on a moving bus despite being accompanied by a male friend, despite the bus rolling through a congregation of police check points, despite the illegal tinted windows and ""school bus"" lettering that should have telegraphed something bizarrely out of the normal. (Delhi gang-rape case verdict: I want to live, she told her mother)

She died on December 29.

On Tuesday, four of the six men arrested for the facinorous attack were found guilty of rape and murder by a fast-track court, one of the changes her case has driven in India. They will be sentenced today; they could face the death penalty. (Delhi gang-rape: They committed the murder of a helpless victim, says judge) | (Gang-rape case: at least 3 of 4 convicts to appeal)

A fifth suspect hanged himself in jail in March; the sixth was 17 at the time of the attack and was sentenced last month to three years in a reform centre. (Juvenile found guilty of rape and murder, gets less than three years in reform home)

Her parents, who had sold their small piece of land in Uttar Pradesh to ensure their only daughter could fulfill her dream of becoming a physiotherapist, sat just a few feet from the convicted men in the congested court-room. They had tears in their eyes when the verdict was read out. Repeatedly, they have asked that the men who took their daughter's life be hanged. (Punish according to crime, not age, says braveheart's mother)

She was looking for a way home on a Sunday night in December, accompanied by her male friend. They had just watched The Life of Pi at a fancy South Delhi mall. It was 9 pm, a reasonable hour even by Delhi's low-achiever safety standards. The men on the private bus that pulled over sold them tickets for Rs. 10 each.

The brutality that followed on board would assail India and then the world within the next few hours.

Her friend was thrown to the back of the bus after being battered with an iron rod, which was later used to violate her. ""18 internal injuries,"" the court order said today, highlighting ""the act of pulling out the internal organ of the victim"" as proof that the plan was to kill her.

45 minutes later, the couple was then thrown from the bus. Her 28-year-old friend has testified that the men tried to run her over, but he pushed her out of the way. ""I never imagined that one human being could treat another so badly,"" he said in an interview. (After raping 'Amanat', men on bus allegedly tried to run her over)

There have been conflicting accounts from him and the police about how long the couple lay bleeding on the road, ignored by passers-by till a police van finally arrived and they were moved to hospital. Doctors who treated her said they had not seen such egregious injuries. ""Her intestines were hanging out,"" said one.

For 10 days, she fought for her life in hospital in Delhi, while students and activists stomped determinedly through water cannons and batons, marching upto the President's door, demanding swift trials for women who are raped, and an overhaul of archaic laws to punish sexual offences.

She testified - twice - from her hospital bed, detailing for the police the actions of the men who she said must be punished. As her condition deteriorated, the government air-lifted her to a Singapore hospital, her parents by her side. She died three days later.

The government introduced new laws which make stalking, voyeurism and sexual harassment a crime, and provide for the death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victim's death. Special courts were also sanctioned to ensure that rape trials progress quickly.

But recent savage attacks, including last month's gang-rape of a photo-journalist in the heart of Mumbai, have underscored how vulnerable women remain, even in India's largest cities.

New Delhi:
India's capital, whose name was mud after the December 16 gang-rape and several such incidents after that, recorded a staggering 1,036 rape cases in the first eight months of this year, according to police data. The figure is the highest in the last 10 years.

From January 1 to August 15, the city recorded 1,036 rape cases, of which the police was able to make arrests in 88 percent of the cases within a few days, data compiled by the Crime Branch said.

In fact, 393 rape cases were recorded in the first quarter from January 1 to March 31. This was more than double the 152 cases recorded in the corresponding period of 2012.

In the next four-and-half months from April 1 to August 15, the number further went up to 643. Against this, 661 cases were reported from January 1 to December 15, 2012 as compared to 564 cases in the like period of 2011.

In 2010, 507 rape cases were registered as compared to 469 in 2009. In 2008, the figure was 466, while in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, and 2003 the figures were 598, 623, 658, 551, and 490.

Police said their investigations have shown that over 90 percent of crimes against women were committed by those known to the victims, while a small percent of them were by strangers.

""In most of the rape cases, accused were known to the victim and this makes prevention of such crimes comparatively more difficult,"" the police officer, on condition of anonymity, told IANS.

According to the officer, post December 16, Delhi Police has been continuously making efforts to spread awareness amongst various sections of the society through 'Parivartan', a campaign for the safety of women in Delhi, and also steadily increasing visibility of women police officers in select police stations, Police Control Room (PCR) vans and motorcycle patrols to curb crimes against women.

""We immediately file rape cases when a victim comes to us. Special care is taken in such investigations. We give emphasis on collecting scientific evidence and all such investigations are carried by women police officers,"" Delhi Police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat told IANS.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the number of rape cases registered in India increased by a startling 870 percent, from 2,487 in 1971 to 24,206 in 2011.

This is more than three times the increase in murder cases in the last 60 years.

As per the NCRB data, Delhi is among the six top-most cities of India where 2.8 percent rape cases were per lakh of population were registered in 2011. Bhopal tops the list, followed by Jabalpur, Gwalior, Indore and Faridabad.

""We have taken a number of steps to instill a sense of security among women. We have women helplines that are manned by women officials also. Women officials are specially trained to address the grievances of the victims,"" Bhagat said.

A special women's cell has also been set up to handle women-related cases.

The barbarous assault drove mass protests and tougher sex laws but the tide of violence against women shows little sign of abating.
New Delhi:
Four men have been convicted today for December's fatal gang rape of a student on a moving bus in Delhi.  The barbarous assault drove mass protests, tougher sex laws and police reforms but the tide of violence against women shows little sign of abating.

Activists say the collective outrage over the attack on the 23-year-old has helped persuade some victims to break their silence.  ""People would never even utter the word rape earlier, but the silence is ending now,"" said Ranjana Kumari, director of the non-profit Centre for Social Research.

She cited a recent case when widely broadcast reports of the gang rape of a photojournalist in Mumbai last month spurred another woman to testify for the first time that she too had been attacked in July by some of the same suspects at the same location -a deserted textile mile in the heart of a city often considered India's safest for women.

While the four convicted on Tuesday of the student's murder and rape had their cases dealt with in a fast-track court, the trial sprawled across more than eight months.

Other rape trials are still waiting to be heard years after the alleged attacks while campaigners say that the mindset of judges needs to be changed as well.

""We have tens of thousands of rape cases pending and very few convictions, which doesn't send a strong message at all,"" cautioned Ms Kumari

A Delhi judge who cleared a defendant last month of sexually assaulting his domestic help upset campaigners when he talked of the ""unprecedented surge in filing of false rape cases"" after the December gang rape.

Police in Delhi, dubbed ""the rape capital' of India, registered more than 800 rapes during the first six months of 2013, more than double the number recorded during the same period the previous year.

Campaigners acknowledge that the government, stung by outrage over the December 16 attack, has taken an important step forward by strengthening anti-rape legislation. Sex offenders can now face the death penalty if a victim dies and it includes provisions to punish police officials who fail to register assault or harassment cases.

The Delhi gang-rape case ignited massive protests in December last year and forced the introduction of tougher laws to punish sexual offences
New Delhi:
""I want to live,"" the young woman told her mother in a Delhi hospital. Outside, on the streets, thousands marched, demanding justice for her and a safer country for women than the one where a student could be raped on a moving bus despite being accompanied by a male friend, despite the bus rolling through a congregation of police check points, despite the illegal tinted windows and ""school bus"" lettering that should have telegraphed something bizarrely out of the normal. (Delhi gang-rape case verdict: I want to live, she told her mother)

She died on December 29, 13 days after she was brutally gang-raped.

Today, four of the six men arrested for the facinorous attack were found guilty of rape and murder by a fast-track court, one of the changes her case has driven in India. They have been convicted on 13 counts, including destruction of evidence, and could face the death penalty. The sentence will be announced tomorrow. (Delhi gang-rape: They committed the murder of a helpless victim, says judge) | (Gang-rape case: at least 3 of 4 convicts to appeal)


A fifth suspect hanged himself in jail in March; the sixth was 17 at the time of the attack and was sentenced last month to three years in a reform centre.  (Juvenile found guilty of rape and murder, gets less than three years in reform home)

Her parents, who had sold their small piece of land in Uttar Pradesh to ensure their only daughter could fulfill her dream of becoming a physiotherapist, sat just a few feet from the convicted men in the congested court-room.   They had tears in their eyes when the verdict was read out.  Repeatedly, they have asked that the men who took their daughter's life be hanged. (Punish according to crime, not age, says braveheart's mother)

She was 23, looking for a way home on December 16, a Sunday night, with her boyfriend. They had just watched The Life of Pi at a fancy South Delhi mall. It was 9 pm, a reasonably safe hour even by Delhi's low-achiever standards. The men on the private bus that pulled over sold them tickets for Rs. 10 each. The brutality that followed on board would assail India and then the world within the next few hours.

Her friend was thrown to the back of the bus after being battered with an iron rod, which was later used to violate her. The police says that in 45 minutes, the gang of six took turns to rape her. The couple was then thrown from the bus. Her 28-year-old- friend has testified that the men tried to run her over, but he pushed her out of the way. ""I never imagined that one human being could treat another so badly,"" he said in an interview.  (After raping 'Amanat', men on bus allegedly tried to run her over)

There have been conflicting accounts from him and the police about how long the couple lay bleeding on the road, ignored by passers-by till a police van finally arrived and they were moved to hospital. Doctors who treated her said they had not seen such egregious injuries. ""Her intestines were hanging out,"" said one.

For 10 days, she fought for her life in hospital in Delhi, while students and activists stomped determinedly through water cannons and batons, marching upto the President's door, demanding swift trials for women who are raped, and an overhaul of archaic laws to punish sexual offences.

She testified -twice- from her hospital bed, detailing for the police the actions of the men who she said must be punished. As her condition deteriorated, the government air-lifted her to a Singapore hospital, her parents by her side. She died three days later.

The government introduced new laws which make stalking, voyeurism and sexual harassment a crime, and provide for the death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victim's death. Special courts were also sanctioned to ensure that rape trials progress quickly.

But since then, a contingent of savage attacks on women and young girls have undermined the potential of the new laws to drive any change. A five-year-old was kidnapped and held hostage in the basement of her building by two men in Delhi; they inserted a bottle and candle in her, raped her, then left her bleeding and tied up. She was discovered by her mother and has gone through five major reconstructive surgeries since then.

Last month, a 22-year-old photo-journalist, accompanied by her male colleague, was shooting a deserted textile mill in the heart of Mumbai when a group of men tied him up with belts and raped her, holding a broken beer bottle to her neck.

New Delhi:
The men were convicted on 13 counts which included destruction of evidence. Lawyers said that the student's testimony, given in hospital before she died, and forensic evidence established their guilt.
Here are 10 big developments in this story:

Two of the men had argued they were not guilty and said they were not on the bus on which the savage crime was committed on December 16.  Their lawyer has said they will appeal against Tuesday's judgement in a higher court.
Arguments for the sentencing of the men - fruit seller Pawan Gupta, bus cleaner Akshay Kumar Singh, gym instructor Vinay Sharma and Mukesh Singh, an unemployed man - will begin today.
The parents of Mukesh Singh,left the crowded court in tears and his mother threw herself at the feet of one of the lawyers, sobbing. His lawyer VK Anand, told reporters: ""My client was simply driving the bus. He confessed fairly that he was driving the bus but he did not know what went on inside.""
The student's parents have said the men must be hanged.
Defence lawyers told reporters that the verdict has been greatly influenced by public and political pressure.
The case became an international headline and ignited a public demand for better safety for women in India.
The woman and her male friend were lured onto a bus by five men and a juvenile, prosecutors argued during the trial. The woman was repeatedly raped, and both she and her companion were severely beaten before being dumped on a road.
The woman, a trainee physiotherapist, died in a Singapore hospital two weeks after the December 16 attack.
One of the five men committed suicide in prison earlier this year, and the teenager was sentenced to three years in juvenile detention last month.
The trial was held in-camera or behind closed doors in a fast-track court; the verdict was delivered in seven months.

Protesters hold a candle-light vigil in Delhi in protest against the gruesome gang-rape of a young physiotherapy student
New Delhi:
As she lay in a maze of tubes on a hospital bed, her insides hollowed out with unspeakable brutality, the 23-year-old medical student told a magistrate that she wanted the six men who had raped and violated her to be brought to justice. ""They must be punished,"" she wrote.

Today, a fast-track court in Delhi found four men guilty of raping and murdering her. They will be sentenced tomorrow.

In the 13 days that she lived after she was gang-raped by six men in a moving bus on December 16, 2012, the young woman became a symbol of hope and courage for an entire country that prayed hard for her life.

""I want to live,"" she told her brother and mother when they first met her in hospital. She couldn't speak, but wrote notes and used gestures, as she weaved in and out of consciousness. Twice, she gave statements to a magistrate.

Doctors said she talked about her future plans. She asked her brother if her missing ATM card and mobile phone SIM had been blocked.

She also repeatedly asked how the male friend who had accompanied her that Sunday evening for a movie at a swish mall in south Delhi was. On the bus, the 28-year-old engineer was beaten unconscious by the six attackers when he tried to defend the young woman.

He visited her in hospital five days after they were attacked. He reportedly wore a jacket she had presented him. She mimed a hug. That was the last time they met.

The engineer's testimony was key in establishing the guilt of the four surviving adult men who were convicted in a fast track court today. A juvenile accused was found guilty of rape and murder last month.

The man considered the gangleader of the group that allegedly inflicted the savage attack, Ram Kumar, committed suicide in jail in March.

On December 30, 2012, the young student died in a Singapore hospital. Her parents say with her died their hope of the better life that she had set out to win for them.

The girl's parents say nothing short of a death sentence will be justice enough.
New Delhi:
""I can never forget how she wept in hospital and said 'they beat me so badly,'"" says the mother of the 23-year-old medical student who was brutally gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi on December 16 last year.

The mother was the first to meet her young daughter in hospital three days after the attack. She was also with her when she died 13 days later of her grievous injuries in a Singapore hospital.

A Delhi court will pronounce verdict today on the role of four adult men accused of the horrific attack. (Live updates)

The girl's parents are present at the Saket court for the verdict. They say nothing short of a death sentence will be justice enough. ""The way these men assaulted her I can't tell you. But the world knows. The world stood behind us and fought with us. These men should be hung till death because they don't deserve to live in our society,"" the mother, weeping bitterly, said last night.

""We are all waiting in anticipation. This is an important verdict not only for us but for the whole country.... If they are not sentenced to death then it's a matter of shame for the entire country,"" her husband said.

Ten days ago, a juvenile board verdict bitterly disappointed the parents. One of the attackers, who was 17 at the time of the assault, was sentenced to three years in a reform centre, the maximum punishment for a juvenile found guilty of rape and murder. (Juvenile found guilty of rape and murder, gets less than three years in reform home)

The student's parents wept after that verdict, describing it as grossly inadequate. ""It is a crime to be born a girl in this country,"" said her father.

It has been a turbulent nine months for the parents of the 23-year-old student. This was the daughter they sold their only piece of land to educate. She was the pivot of hope and aspiration in their cramped household in a crowded Delhi locality.  ""We are still fighting,"" the mother says.

The Delhi gang-rape case outraged the nation and led to massive protests across India in December last year
New Delhi:
Nine months after a 23-year-old student was fatally gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi, a fast-track court will deliver its verdict on four of the six men who were arrested for a crime that shook India to its core, ignited street protests, and forced the introduction of tougher laws to punish sexual offences. (Live updates)

If the four men are found guilty of rape and murder, they could face the death sentence. They have all said they are not guilty. (Five accused plead not guilty)

The girl's parents say nothing short of  a death sentence will be justice enough. ""If they are not sentenced to death then it's a matter of shame for the entire country,"" her father said. (Watch)

The savage attack outraged a country inured to violence against women; thousands marched for days demanding better safety for women and swift justice for the student. (Delhi gang-rape verdict: I want to live, she told her mother)

She had been so badly violated with an iron rod that she died of her injuries two weeks after the attack in a hospital in Singapore, where she was airlifted by a government which apologised for having failed her.

Before that, while she was fighting for her life in hospital in Delhi, she gave a lengthy statement to the police which served as key evidence in the trial. DNA tests and the testimony of her boyfriend who was with her on the bus and was assaulted by the gang will also establish the guilt of the defendants, say prosecutors.  

Of the gang of six who were arrested, one committed suicide in his prison cell in March. (Main accused Ram Singh allegedly commits suicide)

Another was 17 at the time of the assault and was sentenced last month to three years in a reform centre, the maximum punishment for a juvenile found guilty of rape and murder (Juvenile found guilty of rape and murder, gets less than three years in reform home).

The student's parents wept after that verdict, describing it as grossly inadequate. (Punish according to crime, not age, says braveheart's mother)

The police says that when the student and her friend were leaving the mall on a Sunday night after watching a film, the bus with the six men pulled up and promised to drop them home. The men were allegedly drunk and had decided hours earlier to find a woman they could rape that night, prosecutors have argued in court.

The police says the student's friend was assaulted with an iron rod and thrown to the back of the bus before the men took turns to rape the physiotherapy intern. The couple was then thrown naked and bleeding onto the road, and the gang tried to run them over, but the girl's friend pushed her out of the way, the police has claimed. (After raping 'Amanat', men on bus allegedly tried to run her over: sources)

Her case led the government to clear new laws which make stalking, voyeurism and sexual harassment a crime, and provide for the death penalty for repeat offenders or for rape attacks that lead to the victim's death. (President Pranab Mukherjee gives assent to anti-rape bill)

Fast-track courts were also cleared for rape cases.

The horrific incident had outraged the nation.
New Delhi:
A fast-track court is likely to pronounce its verdict today in the Delhi gang-rape case, in which four adult accused were tried for the brutal rape and murder of a 23-year-old paramedical student in a moving bus on December 16 last year.

If the four accused - Vinay Sharma, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh Singh - are found guilty of rape and murder, they may be given the death sentence. The four have denied all charges.

Ram Singh, the prime accused and driver of the bus on which the assault happened, was found dead in his cell in Tihar jail on March 11, almost a month after the trial started. The charges against him were dropped after his death.

The verdict comes ten days after a minor accused was found guilty by the Juvenile Justice Board and sentenced to three years at a detention centre, the maximum sentence under the law.

The victim's parents, dissatisfied with the sentence given to the juvenile, say nothing less than death to the four accused can do justice to their deceased daughter.

The police says the student's friend was assaulted with an iron rod and thrown to the back of the bus before the men took turns to rape the physiotherapy intern. The couple was then thrown naked and bleeding onto the road, and the gang tried to run them over, but the girl's friend pushed her out of the way, the police claimed.

The verdict in the incident, which had evoked nationwide outrage and consequent amendment to the anti-rape laws, follows a trial which concluded after over a hundred hearings.

The four are also accused of robbery and the trial in this case is going on in another Delhi court.

Mumbai:
Rapes by minors are on the rise, according to official data.

Figures on juvenile crimes by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reveal that from 2002 to 2012, there has been a 143 per cent increase in the number of rapes by juveniles.

In the same period, figures of murders committed by minors went up by 87 per cent while there has been a whopping 500 per cent increase in the number of kidnappings of women and girls by minors.

However, as shocking as these statistics may be, it is important to remember that over the last five years (2007-2012 ) heinous crimes like rape and murder add up to just about eight per cent of total spectrum of crimes by minors.

72 per cent of the cases against minors between 2007 and 2012 were for theft, burglary and causing hurt.

But do rising crime figures paint the entire picture? Many point out the official data put out is not nuanced, so often cases reported as rapes by minors are consensual love affairs or even instances of exploratory sex.

""Though there has not been a rise in juvenile crime rates as such, there has been an increase in the severity of the crimes committed by juveniles. Also the 17 year olds are aware that they are juveniles and take advantage of the fact saying you cannot take us in for questioning etc"",  says Mumbai Joint Police commissioner Himanshu Roy of the challenges the police is facing in tackling crimes by minors.

Mr Roy heads the crime branch which is investigating the case of a 23-year-old photojournalist who was gang-raped in Mumbai, in which one accused is a minor.

Some are also of the view that looking at the severity of crimes committed by minors, there is a need to toughen the law against them.

The debate has been sparked off after the juvenile in the December 16 Delhi gang-rape case held guilty for rape and murder was sent to a reform home for three years as punishment. That clearly is not enough says former IPS officer Kiran Bedi.

""There is a need to revisit the juvenile justice act. For heinous crimes like rape it should be left to the judge to decide whether the act committed is committed by a child or not"" she points out.

Others like Lawyer and Activist Flavia Agnes disagree. Ms Flavia says that juvenile crime is a reflection of a break down in our society. The onus is on society to rehabilitate the child.

Explaining her stand, she says, ""Look at it from the child's point of view. Many of these kids come from single parent homes. Often there is no father, so the kids become school dropouts and their mother is at work whole day trying to make ends meet and what does the child do? They run errands for drug addicts for bootlegging, petty theft, selling stuff procured through theft. This is the training ground. So here we are creating a society of young juvenile prostitutes, young juvenile criminals and saying give them death penalty, give them life imprisonment, give them stringent punishment. Okay, so we punish 10, 20, 100, are we going to have a better society?""

As the debate widens it forces us to ask: is our neglect and society's apathy towards our children one of the main reason they become so deviant?

New Delhi:
In a small house, a five-year-old plays with her three-year-old brother on a weekday. School is not an option for now. She has been in and out of hospital, and this is the fourth home she has lived in since April.

That is when she was kidnapped and raped by two men. While she fought for her life in hospital, India united in anger with the same sort of force that had triggered massive protests when a medical student was fatally gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi in December 2012.

A series of glaring lapses drove home how little appeared to have changed. When she was kidnapped, her father was offered a bribe of Rs 2,000 to go away. The police never bothered to search the building she lived in. It was her mother who discovered her two days later in the basement, tied up, starving, bleeding. Bottles and candles had been inserted in her.

Protests were held, demanding action against the police. Flowers and stuffed toys were sent to her by strangers.

Two men were arrested for the assault on the child, named ""Gudiya"" or Doll by sections of the media.

When she was declared better and allowed to go home in May, relief fizzed in the air.

Since then, however, Gudiya's family, has fought for recovery without any support. They were given a lakh by the government as compensation, and moved to a hostel so that the child could recover far away from the building where she had been kidnapped and tortured.

But within two months, hostel officials asked the family to leave. Gudiya's father, who earns around Rs 100 on the days when he finds work as a hired hand, says he has rented four different homes, each move driven by the desire to protect his daughter from the murmurs that spread through the neighbourhood when her story was discovered.

""So many leaders like Sonia Gandhi and Sushma Swaraj had come and promised help,"" he said to NDTV. ""Now, their people don't even take our calls.""

Since she left hospital, the child has gone through four major surgeries. The operations are paid for by the government, but the cost of commuting and medicines is not small, her father said.

A fast-track court is trying the two men accused of raping her; a few weeks ago, she was taken there to recount what happened, but was unable to share the nightmarish details.

""She went twice to the court. The first time, she just signalled that she had been hurt on her neck and below the waist. The other time she could not say anything at all,"" he said.

Her mother says she would have preferred for the child to not be made to testify.

New Delhi:
Four rapes have been reported in the past three days in the capital, three involving little girls who knew their attackers.

In a fifth case, a teenager has alleged molestation by her own step-father. All the accused have been arrested.

Just after the youngest accused in the horrific Delhi gangrape was sentenced to three years in a reform home, a nine-year-old has been allegedly raped and brutalized by a neighbor only a few years older.

The girl was attacked in the toilet of her own house. The boy allegedly inserted a water pipe inside the girl, for which she had a surgery. He has been arrested and sent to a juvenile home.

Another nine-year-old was allegedly raped by an auto-driver, Om Prakash, who knew her and often gave her a ride home from school for five rupees.

Om Prakash, 42, allegedly threatened her with a knife, took her to a deserted spot in Ghaziabad and raped her. He later asked another auto-driver to take her home. But the second auto-driver drove straight to the police station after the girl told him what had happened. Om Prakash has been arrested.

In another case where the girl knew her alleged attacker, a 13-year-old has accused her step-father of molesting her in their east Delhi home.

On Sunday evening, a four-year-old girl who had gone to watch TV at a shop near her house was allegedly lured away by a 19-year-old man, Raju, and raped near railway tracks. Raju has been arrested. The police say he works as a carpenter in the area.

In the same area in west Delhi, a woman was sexually assaulted in the slums allegedly by two men who caught her when she was looking for her son. Both men have been arrested.

Policemen escort the juvenile accused at a Delhi court on Saturday. (AFP)
New Delhi:
Amid demand that a juvenile be defined as a person below 16 years and not 18, Delhi's Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung today suggested the law could be changed to lower that to even 14. Young people, he said, grow up faster these days.

Mr Jung was referring to Saturday's verdict of the juvenile justice board, which found the youngest accused in the brutal gang-rape and murder of a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi last December guilty and sentenced him to three years at a reform centre.

""The verdict left me dissatisfied. I'm personally not happy. I felt this man got away very lightly. The whole idea of having laws is to deliver justice. I don't think justice has been done in this case thus far,"" Mr Jung, who took over recently as Delhi's Lt Governor, said.

The juvenile was a few months short of 18 at the time of the crime, which incensed India and forced the introduction of tougher laws for sexual crimes. The eight months he has already spent in a home since his arrest will be knocked off his sentence.

Mr Jung said the law must be revisited. ""The juvenile age should be lowered to 16 at least. These days young people grow up much faster. Even if juvenile age is lowered to 14, there would be nothing wrong with that,"" he said.

The student's parents have said they will appeal against Saturday's verdict in a higher court.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case filed by BJP leader Subramanian Swamy which seeks to change the legal definition of a juvenile.

Of the five adults who were arrested in the case, one was found hanging in jail in March. The others are being tried by a special fast-track court and could face the death sentence if convicted. The verdict on them is expected this month.

The 23-year-old woman was brutally gang-raped by six men on December 16. She died from her injuries two weeks later in a Singapore hospital.

The mother of the physiotherapy intern who died after being gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi in December said today's verdict is unacceptable to them.
New Delhi:
The father of the student who was fatally gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi today said, ""It is a crime to be born a girl in this country.""

Like his wife, he broke down after a juvenile court found one of the six accused guilty of rape and murder.

Because he was 17 when he committed the crime, he has been sentenced to three years in a reform home, but the judge knocked off eight months for the time he has already spent in a juvenile centre since his arrest.

The parents of the physiotherapy intern who died said the juvenile should be hanged.

""Only three years? This is unacceptable. They may as well acquit him now,"" said her mother.

The brutal assault on their daughter who was violated with an iron rod incensed the country, which held its breath while she fought for two weeks for her life, first in Delhi and then in Singapore where she was airlifted by the government.

Street protests demanded tougher anti-rape laws which were introduced a few months ago by the government.

The juvenile was also acquitted of attempting to murder the girl's male friend who was with her and had been attacked by the gang before the couple was thrown naked onto the road.

One of the five others arrested killed himself in jail in March. The four others are being tried by a special fast-track court expected to deliver its verdict in mid-September.

New Delhi:
A verdict in the case of the Delhi gang-rape, which provoked a symmetry of national anger and grief, is likely to be delivered in the middle of September.

Six men were arrested for the assault on a young intern and her boyfriend on a moving bus in December. She died of her injuries two weeks later.

The countrywide outrage prompted the government to order a fast-track trial in a special Delhi court- it has been in progress for seven months.

Of the six suspects, one was 17 at the time of the crime and is being tried by a juveniles court. Another committed suicide in jail in March.

The prosecution concluded its arguments in the case today; defence lawyers are scheduled to wrap their case in the first week of September. Lawyers for both sides say a verdict should be delivered by the middle of next month.

Before she died, the 23-year-old physiotherapy trainee gave a detailed statement to the police in hospital. Her boyfriend has also provided crucial evidence, investigators have said. DNA samples are being relied on to link the suspects to the savage attack.

The four defendants are accused of convincing the woman and her male companion to board an off-duty bus after the pair had watched an evening movie at an upscale shopping mall. The police say the men then raped the woman, using a metal rod to inflict such horrific injuries that she died two weeks later at a Singapore hospital. The four adult defendants all face charges of gang rape, murder and kidnapping and are likely to face the death sentence if convicted.

The verdict in the trial of the juvenile is expected at the end of this month.

Sketches: File pics of the five accused in the Mumbai gang-rape.
Mumbai:
All five suspects in the case of the young photographer who was raped in the heart of Mumbai have been arrested. Four of them will remain in police custody till August 30, a court has said. The fifth accused, caught in Delhi yesterday, was brought to Mumbai last night and has been sent to police custody .

The woman was shooting a deserted textile mill with a male colleague when the attackers tied him up with belts, and raped her.  

The police say that interrogation of the men in jail indicates that this gang may have sexually assaulted other women in the past. Some of the accused had been released on bail after having been arrested on charges ranging from breaking into houses to robbery; none has a record of any sexual offence.

But investigators say that their behaviour during Thursday's assault of the 22-year-old photographer suggested a malevolent confidence and practice. For example, the men allegedly took two photos of the woman after they had attacked her and threatened to release these if she reported them to the police.

Investigators also cite the fact that the gang allegedly ordered the woman to clean up the scene of the crime as an indicator that they were not first-time offenders.  

After they released the survivor and her male colleague, they went to their homes; some watched movies, police sources said, others went to sleep.  

The alleged leader of the gang, Salim Ansari, 27, escaped to Delhi after the arrest of the first suspect, Chand Sheikh, on Friday morning. After tracking Ansari's mobile phone and interrogating his family members, the Mumbai cops found out that he had left for Delhi from Kurla station. 

Ansari, picked up from West Delhi this morning, had allegedly planned to stay with a relative there before moving to Bihar and then to Bangladesh.

File photo of Kasim Bangali who was arrested this morning
Mumbai:
Nearly 60 hours after a young photojournalist and her male colleague were assaulted and she was raped in the heart of Mumbai, the police have found the man they describe as the ""most depraved"" among the gang of five that allegedly assaulted her. He allegedly was the most violent of the attackers and raped her twice. (Brave survivor says she wants to work again)

Kasim Bangali, in his late twenties and the eldest of the five accused, was picked up by the police from the Mumbai suburbs this morning.

""If he is guilty, he should face the law. But if he's not, help us prove he's innocent,"" his mother, Chand Bibi, told NDTV, hours before he was caught.

The five had assaulted the 22-year-old at a deserted textile mill in Lower-Parel on Thursday evening, sparking anger across the country similar to the outrage that upped after a young student was fatally gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi in December. (Watch: The Mumbai incident reminded me of my child, says Delhi braveheart's mother)

Four of the five suspects have been arrested.

Kasim's mother said he returned home at around 9 pm on the day of the rape and went to sleep. Two hours later, he left hurriedly after receiving a call from a policeman who later told Chand Bibi, ""How long can he run? One day we will catch him. Where is he?""

A sketch of all five attackers was released to the public on Friday morning; it had been compiled based on inputs from the woman and her colleague.

The woman's male friend was tied up with a belt by the gang after the couple finished shooting their assignment at Shakti Mill for a local magazine. A beer bottle was held over her head as the men took turns to rape her, she has said in a statement to the police (Read).

After the half-an-hour attack, the gang escorted the couple to a nearby train station to ensure they would not go directly to the police from the scene of the crime. The journalists phoned a senior executive at their office for help; he rushed to the station and then took them by taxi to the hospital where the woman is now recovering from internal and external injuries.

Protest against the gang-rape of a 22-year-old photojournalist in Mumbai on Friday
New Delhi:
As Mumbai reeled on Friday from the shock of a 22-year-old photojournalist being gang-raped in the heart of the city, in Delhi a special court began to hear the final arguments in the December 16 gang-rape case.

More than one person has since yesterday pointed to the chilling similarities in the brutal attacks on the two young women, eight months and many miles apart. Asking the question - has anything changed for women since?

Mumbai's police commissioner, promising to knit a strong case against the men accused of raping the photojournalist also requested yesterday that a fast-track court deal with the case.
The Delhi gang-rape case is being tried by a fast track court. On December 16 2012, six men brutally raped a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus.  She died two weeks later.

Within days of the incident the police had arrested six men, five adults and one minor, and filed a 33-page chargesheet against the five adult accused - Ram Singh, Mukesh Singh, Akshay Thakur, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma.

The trial began on January 3 when the police filed the chargesheet.

On March 11, Ram Singh, said to be the ringleader in the gang-rape, was found dead at Delhi's Tihar Jail under mysterious circumstances. Amid accusations of foul play by his family, proceedings against him were wound up.

It has already been eight months since the rape and questions are being asked on how fast is fast track. As per the law, the case is being heard on daily basis. But those watching proceedings say much of the delay is because the defence counsels have tried delay tactics. They have often been rebuked by the court for this.

In the past few months three of the accused - Vinay, Pawan and Akshay - have refuted the statements they made when charges were being framed against them.

Then, each had claimed that he was in the bus on that Sunday evening in December but did not rape the girl. Now, each claims that he was not on the bus at all.

The prosecution hopes that the trial will be over by the end of this month.

Verdict is also expected on August 31 on the alleged role of the one minor being tried by the juvenile justice board. There have been many demands, also from the parents of the medical student, that he be tried as an adult as his alleged crime was no less heinous.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court on Saturday allowed the accused in the December 16 gang-rape case to bring two more witnesses in their defence and fixed August 22 for the start of hearing of the final arguments in the case.

Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna, while fixing the date for final arguments in the case, directed the counsel for accused Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta to close their evidence on Monday without making any ""delay or excuses"".

""I am fixing Thursday (August 22) for final arguments, so now conclude your (accused) evidence before it,"" the judge said, adding no further chance will be given to them.

The court's order came on an application filed by Vinay who had sought to call three new witnesses to establish that the prosecution witnesses, whose statements were recorded by the court, were ""false"" and were ""tutored"".

Vinay's counsel had said the prosecution was allowed to bring their witnesses during recording of defence witness' testimonies.

""If they were allowed to bring new witnesses, we should also be given an opportunity to produce our witness in the interest of justice and fair trial on behalf of the accused,"" the counsel added.

The court had already concluded recording statements of the defence witnesses in the case but it observed the accused should be given a last chance in the interest of justice and for a fair trial.

Vinay had claimed that on December 16, he had gone to a music event organised by the Church in the DDA district park at Hauz Khas in south Delhi and co-accused Pawan Gupta was also present there.

However, his claim was refuted by prosecution witnesses.

According to the prosecution, Ram Singh, Vinay, Akshay, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh had allegedly gang-raped the girl in a moving bus. The medical student died of injuries on December 29 last year while undergoing treatment in a Singapore hospital.

During the trial, Ram Singh was found dead in Tihar Jail on March 11 and court proceedings against him stand abated.

The sixth accused, a juvenile, is facing inquiry before the juvenile justice board in Delhi.

In the December 16 gang-rape case, a minor was produced as a witness in a Delhi court by the defence on Saturday. The boy produced a video clipping which showed that two of the four adults accused and facing trial were present at the music function on the night of the incident.

A 15-year-old boy, appearing in defence of Vinay Sharma, showed a video recording to Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna pointing out that Vinay and co-accused Pawan Gupta was present in the music function in south Delhi at the time of the incident.

Special Public Prosecutor Dayan Krishnan and Rajiv Mohan, however, counter the minor's contention saying he had concocted a false story at the behest of the accused and his family members.

However, the boy rejected the prosecution allegation saying he is not lying as he has taken oath in the name of God and is deposing the correct facts.

""There was no musical programme organised on December 16, 2012 in the evening time in the district park (south Delhi).

The DDA/horticulture department does not allow such programme in the park and no one is allowed to enter the park after 7:00 pm in the evening,"" the prosecution said.

During the proceedings on Saturday, the police also moved an application seeking summoning of three material witnesses in the case to prove that no activities such as musical events are permitted in the said park as claimed by the accused.

The court has kept the application pending saying it would decide it after defence witnesses' statement is closed.

As per the prosecution, the six persons in the bus were driver Ram Singh, Vinay, Akshay, Pawan, Mukesh and a juvenile and all of them had raped the girl and assaulted her male friend with an iron rod.

The victim died of her injuries on December 29 last year while undergoing treatment in a Singapore hospital.

During the trial, Ram Singh allegedly committed suicide in Tihar Jail on March 11 and court proceedings against him stand abated.

The sixth accused, a juvenile, faced an inquiry before the juvenile justice board in Delhi.

New Delhi:
False cases are the reasons behind labelling of Delhi as 'rape capital'; a court in Delhi has held while acquitting a 75-year-old man of the charge of sexually assaulting his maid after the woman turned hostile.

The court said after the December 16 gang-rape of a 23-year-old girl in a moving bus lead to the creation of an atmosphere that ""the mere statement of a lady that she has been raped, came to be taken as gospel truth, the accused arrested and chargesheeted"".

""This lead to an unprecedented surge in filing of false rape cases...It is these false cases which play havoc with the crime statistics, leading to the labelling of Delhi as a 'rape capital',"" Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat said, while acquitting Bhopal Sharma of the charge of sexually assaulting his maid.

The court observed that as acquittals in such cases are hardly ever reported, the falsely implicated persons lose their honour, dignity and status in the society and though these cannot be restored, ""these victims"" can be compensated so that they can start life afresh.

It also noted that ""it is a matter of intense regret that even the frail, sick and aged persons are not spared from the false allegations of rape"".

According to the prosecution, Sharma and his neighbour Anita had become friends when they met in a hospital  where his ailing wife was admitted. After his wife's death, Anita had arranged for the woman, who was in her 30s, to work as a maid in his home.

The maid in her complaint had said a few days after she started working at Sharma's house in July 2012; he had raped her and after the incident, had promised to marry her.

Thereafter, he continued to have sexual relations with her on the pretext of marrying her, the maid had alleged, adding that she lodged the police complaint on October 11, 2012 after Sharma expressed his unwillingness to keep his promise.

However, during the trial, the woman turned hostile and said she had levelled false allegations on the advice of Anita and another person Kuldeep.

While acquitting Sharma, the judge noted that the maid, a divorcee, had levelled the allegation of rape against the senior citizen on the behest of her neighbour Anita and Kuldeep in order to usurp the man's property.

Expressing the need for courts to be empowered to award compensation to victims of false rape cases, the judge also lamented that media turns a blind eye to acquittals in such cases.

""Nobody bothers to see in how many cases the accused in fact are convicted. Media turns a blind eye towards acquittals. The acquittal of an accused is not noticed at all and he continues to be labelled as a 'rapist' even after his honourable acquittal.

""Their lost honour, dignity and status in the society cannot be restored but they can be compensated so that they are able to start life afresh. The courts need to be empowered to award compensation to men acquitted in false rape cases,"" the court said.

The judge also said right from the first day when accused was produced before him, he had wondered, ""How such a frail old man, who cannot even stand straight, would rape a young lady in her mid-30's, having lot more strength than the accused?""

New Delhi:
In a relief to MDLR airlines employee Aruna Chadha, the Delhi High Court today not only quashed the charges of abetment of rape and unnatural sex against her but also held that they  cannot be ""sustained"" against prime accused Gopal Kanda in the airhostess suicide case.

""It is apparent that the ASJ (additional sessions judge) unjustly admitted into evidence the confessional statement made by the petitioner (Chadha) and illegally put the burden to prove the same on the co-accused (Kanda) and the Petitioner which is not permissible.

""The ASJ fell into gross error in framing the charge under Sections 376/377 (rape and unnatural sex) against the co-accused GGK (Kanda) which cannot be sustained. Since no charge against co-accused under these Sections could have been framed, the Petitioner could not have been guilty of abetting these offences,"" Justice G P Mittal said.

The verdict, which came on the plea of Chadha, referred to her statement to police and held that except the disclosure statement, there was ""not even a shred of evidence"" to show that Kanda sexually exploited the victim and Chadha abetted in the commission of these offences.

""Apart from the supplementary disclosure statement of the Petitioner AC (Chadha) there is nothing to indicate that co-accused GGK (Kanda) had illicit relations with 'X' (victim) or that she had multiple pregnancies...

""All the more, there is not even a shred of evidence to indicate that co-accused GGK committed sexual intercourse with deceased 'X' or had carnal intercourse against the order of nature with her or that the same was against her (the deceased) will or without her consent or that the Petitioner facilitated in any act of rape or unnatural offence alleged to have been committed by GGK,"" the court said.

""...the petition is partly allowed to the extent that the framing of the charge for the offence punishable under Section 376/109 and Section 377/109 IPC is set aside,"" it said.

Giving major relief to former Haryana minister Gopal Goyal Kanda's aide Aruna Chadha, the Delhi High Court on Thursday dismissed the charges of abetment of rape and unnatural sex against her in airhostess suicide case.

Justice GP Mittal also held that charges of rape and unnatural sex cannot be sustained against prime accused Gopal Kanda.

""It is apparent that the ASJ (additional sessions judge) unjustly admitted into evidence the confessional statement made by the petitioner (Chadha) and illegally put the burden to prove the same on the co-accused (Kanda) and the petitioner which is not permissible,"" the court said.

Justice Mittal added: ""The ASJ fell into gross error in framing the charge under Sections 376/377 (rape and unnatural sex) against the co-accused GGK (Kanda) which cannot be sustained. Since no charge against co-accused under these sections could have been framed, the petitioner could not have been guilty of abetting these offences.""

The court's direction came on the plea of Chadha against framing of fresh charges of abetment of rape and suicide against her in the case.

The court, referring to Chadha's statement to police, held that except the disclosure statement, there was not even a shred of evidence to show that Kanda sexually exploited the victim and Chadha abetted in the commission of these offences.

""Apart from the supplementary disclosure statement of the petitioner AC (Chadha), there is nothing to indicate that co-accused GGK (Kanda) had illicit relations with 'X' (victim) or that she had multiple pregnancies...,"" the court said.

Justice Mittal, allowing the plea of Chadha, said: ""...the petition is partly allowed to the extent that the framing of the charge for the offence punishable under Section 376/109 and Section 377/109 IPC is set aside.""

The trial court had framed additional and fresh charges of rape and unnatural offence against Kanda and Chadha who was also booked for abetting the commission of these offences.

The high court held that some offences, including abetment of suicide, was made out against them, but there was no prima facie evidence indicating that they were also involved in the commission of rape and unnatural sex.

Justice Mittal also allowed another plea of Delhi Police for expunging the trial court's adverse remarks for not probing the sexual exploitation angle in the case.

Chadha and Kanda have been charged with rape, abetment of rape, abetment of suicide, criminal conspiracy, forgery under the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act for hacking computers and sending offensive or false messages.

The air hostess was found hanging from the ceiling fan of a room at her house in north Delhi August 5 last year.

She left behind two suicide notes blaming Kanda and Chadha, who are now in judicial custody, but have denied any involvement in the suicide.

In their charge sheet, police had said that Kanda was obsessed with the air hostess and he and Chadha had unleashed a series of wilful and malicious acts of mental torture, threat, blackmail and stress on her, which led her to take the extreme step.

Kanda was arrested Aug 18 last year after he surrendered at north Delhi's Ashok Vihar police, while Chadha was apprehended Aug 8. Police filed the charge sheet Oct 6.

New Delhi:
The trial in the rape case of a five-year-old child allegedly involving two youths today commenced in a Delhi court with the girl's mother bursting into tears during her testimony.

The mother got back her composure after being consoled by the judge and lawyers and identified accused Manoj Shah saying he was one of the two who had raped her daughter.

Deposing before Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Garg, the woman said she knows only Manoj as he was their neighbour and she does not know co-accused Pradeep Kumar.

The court fixed August 1 for recording statements of the victim and her father in the case.

The 23-year-old woman, the first prosecution witness in the case, told the court that her daughter had been missing since April 15 and on the morning of April 17, she was found locked in a room in the same building where they stay.

When they broke the lock of the room, where Manoj was staying on rent, they found the minor lying on the ground, crying and bleeding, she said.

She said there were marks on the child's neck which supports the police theory that the accused had tried to kill the girl by strangulating and slitting her throat.

When the police reached the spot in Gandhi Nagar area of East Delhi, the family members and cops took the child to a hospital where doctors took out pieces of candle and bottle from her body, the woman, whose recording of statement concluded today, said.

On being asked by defence counsel R S Juneja if she had any enmity with the accused, the woman replied in negative saying she never had any quarrel with Manoj.

The duo are accused of raping the five-year-old girl on April 15. The girl was rescued 40 hours later on April 17 and is under treatment.

The accused had fled after committing the crime and were arrested from Bihar, according to police.

New Delhi:
The father of an accused in the December 16 gang-rape case on Saturday told a special court in Delhi that his son was not on the bus in which a 23-year-old girl was gang-raped by six people.

Heera Lal, father of accused Pawan Gupta, defending his son before Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna, claimed his son is innocent and has been falsely implicated.

""I asked my daughter about Pawan and she informed that his son had come to the jhuggi (house) and taken drink and chicken and thereafter had gone to the district park to attend some music function. I then went to the district park along with my brother-in-law in his car to bring Pawan. A musical programme was going on and I found my son lying on the bench,"" Lal said.

He said that as Pawan was heavily drunk and was not in a position to walk, he and his brother-in-law had lifted him from the park and put him a car.

""Though we put water on Pawan's face to bring him back to senses, he was heavily intoxicated and came to senses on December 17, 2012 morning,"" Pawan's father claimed.

Earlier during recording his statement before the court, Pawan had also claimed that he was not in the bus and had gone to a music function along with co-accused Vinay Sharma.

However, one of the accused Mukesh told the court that he was driving the bus in which the girl was raped and her friend was attacked by his elder brother Ram Singh (deceased), Vinay, Pawan, Akshay Thakur and the juvenile who is being tried by a juvenile justice board separately.

Same were the submissions of the other three defence witnesses in the case.

The medical student died of her injuries on December 29 last year while undergoing treatment in a Singapore hospital.

During the trial, Ram Singh was found dead in Tihar Jail on March 11 and court proceedings against him stand abated.

Kolkata:
Six weeks after a 20-year-old college student was gang-raped and murdered at Kamduni village in West Bengal, her family, friends and neighbours today boarded a train for Delhi to meet the President on Monday and demand a CBI probe into the brutal crime.

""I have no demand. I don't want a job, a house or compensation. I want the culprits to be hanged,"" said the girl's father.

The villagers who are accompanying the family say they have no faith in the probe being conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police.

""We are going to demand CBI. We can't bank on the CID anymore. They also produced a bogus chargesheet in court. How can we trust them anymore?"" says Pradip Mukherjee, a teacher.

Ten days after the ghastly crime, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had visited the girl's family. But she was angered by slogan shouting villagers demanding quick justice. As she was leaving the village, several women ran after her demanding to speak to her. That apparently angered her even more. She then turned towards the women, and told them to shut up. She also called the villagers CPM cadres and Maoists.

This left the villagers antagonised. Later, when the CID produced a chargesheet in a local court, the judge punched gaping holes in it and ordered a revised chargesheet to be presented. Among the most glaring discrepancies in the earlier chargesheet was the fact that while seven people were accused of gang-rape, only one person was named in the attached case diary as having committed the crime.

Miffed by the CID, the villagers then decided to meet the President.

The move is unlikely to please Ms Banerjee. But the villagers clearly feel that after being labeled Maoists and CPM by her, they are not going to get justice at the hands of the state authorities.

Six people, including a juvenile, were arrested for the horrific assault on a 23-year-old medical student in a moving bus in Delhi on December 16 last. She died 13 days later. The Juvenile Justice Board, hearing the minor's case, will deliver its verdict on July 25. The other accused are being tried by a fast track court. They have been charged with rape, murder, kidnapping, destruction of evidence and the attempted murder of the student's male companion.
They are
Mukesh Singh is the younger brother of the main accused Ram Singh. They were arrested from Rajasthan. Mukesh lived with his brother in Ravidas camp, a slum in south Delhi. Mukesh has pleaded innocence and accused the other five of raping the woman while the companion of the woman has alleged Mukesh and his brother Ram took turns driving the bus and assaulting her.
Vinay Sharma was an assistant gym instructor and Ram Singh's neighbor in Delhi. He was the fourth to be arrested in the case on Dec 18. Sharma has repeatedly alleged that he faces a threat to his life in Tihar Jail, where he and the other adult accused are lodged. In April, he appeared in court with a bandaged hand and alleged being beaten up by other inmates. In March, he had also sought a tutor in jail as well as nutritious food for his preparations for the Indian Air Force exam.
Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller, was arrested in Delhi with Ram Singh and Mukesh, a day after the assault on December 17.

New Delhi:
The Juvenile Justice Board hearing the December 16 gang-rape and murder of a 23-year-old medical student in Delhi will deliver its verdict on July 25. The accused minor faces a maximum sentence of three years in a correctional facility, including the time he has already spent in one. The student's father has said all the six men accused of raping and murdering her must get the death sentence.
This is the story so far:
The Juvenile Justice Board will deliver its verdict in the gang-rape case on July 25. The minor faces a maximum sentence of three years in a correctional facility, including the time he has already spent in one. More lenient punishment could include having to do community service. Whatever the verdict, the name of the accused and his role in the crime will remain permanently sealed. His crime will not reflect when he applies for jobs in the future.
The father of the 23-year-old medical student told NDTV today, ""We cry every day remembering our daughter. A strict judgement is our only hope for justice. Our fight, the nation's cry will go waste if strict punishment is not granted.""
The police, in their inquiry report to the Juvenile Justice Board, have alleged that the juvenile, who was 17-and-a-half years old when the medical student was raped, was an equal participant in the gruesome assault. They have in fact claimed that he was the ""most brutal"" of all the six accused.
The police have also alleged that it was this man who stood at the door of the private luxury bus and called out to commuters to board the bus on the evening of the crime. The police allege that the six men on the bus planned to rob commuters.
The family of the medical student had pleaded that the teen be tried as an adult alongside the others accused; they said that his age does not make his crime any less heinous. Despite a lot of debate and several appeals, the Justice Verma Commission, set up to suggest more stringent laws against rape, did not reduce the definition of ""juvenile"" for crime  from 18 to 16.
The Juvenile Justice Board headed by Principal Magistrate Geetanjali Goel is also expected to give its judgement today in another case against the juvenile from the same day. He and the adult accused are charged with robbing Ramadhar, a carpenter, who had boarded the bus and was thrown out before the young student and her friend were assaulted.
During the inquiry, the juvenile had denied all accusations, claiming that he had not participated in the crime. The juvenile's counsel had submitted that there was no medical evidence to connect him with the crime and that no fingerprints could be detected in the bus to show his complicity.
The accused belongs to Uttar Pradesh. His father bed-ridden and family extremely poor, he had come to Delhi to earn a living. The police say he initially kept in touch with the family but then they lost contact with him.
The six men accused in the case were arrested within a week of the brutal gang-rape on December 16, which led to weeks of protests in the capital and elsewhere. The trial of four adult suspects is being conducted in a fast-track court in Delhi. A fifth accused, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail on March 11.
The 23-year-old medical student was gang-raped and brutally assaulted with an iron rod by six men, reportedly drunk, on a moving bus in Delhi on December 16. A male friend accompanying her was also beaten badly. After the assault, they were thrown on to the road. The girl died 13 days later in a Singapore hospital.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court is set to hand down the first verdict on Thursday on one of five suspects on trial over the fatal gang-rape of a student on a moving bus, which sparked an outcry in India.

A juveniles' court in the capital has finished hearing the case of the teenager (one of the accused in the case), aged 17 at the time of the crime, who faces a maximum sentence of three years in a correctional facility if found guilty.

The sentence is likely to cause further outrage in a country attempting to turn a rising tide of violence against women and which has passed a new law toughening sentences for adults convicted of sex crimes.

The victim's family led calls for the teenager to be tried as an adult, alongside five men initially arrested over the brutal gang-rape on December 16, which led to weeks of protests in the capital and elsewhere.

The 23-year-old victim passed away in a Singapore hospital after 13 days on December 28.

The trial of four adult suspects continues but is expected to wrap up in the next few months, with the men facing a possible death sentence if convicted of rape and murder.

The fifth adult, Ram Singh, allegedly committed suicide in jail.

If found guilty, the juvenile can be sent to a correctional facility for a maximum three-year term, which includes the time he has already spent in custody while waiting for the verdict.

Anant Kumar Asthana, a Delhi-based lawyer who defends juveniles, explained that ""the idea behind the provision is that three years is sufficient time to reform a child"".

""The institutionalisation of a child is a last resort, and the idea is to do it for a minimum amount of time... since institutionalisation can often impact a child negatively,"" Asthana told AFP.

Criminal charges against staff at a number of juvenile homes last year have highlighted what activists describe as a pervasive culture of violence that begins with carers abusing wards and ends with older children assaulting younger children.

Shahbaz Khan, co-founder of Haq: Centre for Child Rights, which has provided counselling to the juvenile in the Delhi gang-rape case, told AFP the services provided in homes are usually inadequate.

""Counselling services are very poor. Staff are paid very little and are not at all eager to work with these children,"" Khan said.

""Some homes will offer tailoring classes or cooking classes, but these kids are damaged, they need mentors. The law on juveniles has all these provisions, but the reality is something else,"" he said.

A government panel set up after the Delhi gang-rape to recommend changes to sex crime laws rejected calls to lower the age at which people can be tried as adults from 18 to 16.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court today fixed July 11 for giving its order on whether to frame charges against two persons, arrested for allegedly raping a five-year-old child in a rented accommodation in New Delhi.

Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Garg, who is presiding over special court under the POCSO Act, will pass its order in the case in which accused Manoj Shah, 22, and Pradeep Kumar, 20, were arrested for their alleged involvement in the crime.

Meanwhile, the court took on record a report filed by the jail authorities in pursuance to its order to make appropriate arrangements for ""safety and security"" of accused Pradeep, who is lodged in Tihar Jail in judicial custody and had complained of being beaten up by undertrials in the prison van.

The jail authorities said in its report that from now onwards, Pradeep would be brought to the court in a separate vehicle from jail and would be kept separately in the lock up also.

A report was sought from the jail superintendent and lock up in-charge after Pradeep had complained to the judge that he was often beaten by other undertrials when he, along with co-accused Manoj Shah, was brought to the court from the prison in the jail van.

Manoj and Pradeep are accused of brutally raping a five-year-old girl on April 15 in a building in east Delhi's
Gandhi Nagar locality where the victim and accused lived.

The girl was rescued 40 hours later on April 17 and is under treatment at AIIMS.

Manoj and Pradeep, who had fled after committing the crime, were arrested from Bihar, according to the police.

Delhi Police had on May 24 filed a charge sheet against the duo under provisions of the Protection of Children from
Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act relating to aggravated sexual assault and for offences including procuring a minor girl, kidnapping, wrongful confinement, attempt to murder and destruction of evidence under the IPC.

The offences, for which the accused have been charge sheeted, if proved, entails a maximum punishment of life term.

New Delhi:
Delhi Police has filed a chargesheet in a city court against two men for brutally raping a five-year-old girl two months ago, under stringent provisions of newly enacted law for protection of children which entails maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

The kidnapping and rape of the minor in east Delhi had sparked public outrage against the alleged apathy of police in registering the case, leading to the suspension and transfer of cops of various ranks including an ACP, caught on camera slapping a young girl who was part of a crowd protesting the incident.

The accused Manoj Shah, 22 and Pradeep Kumar, 20, who had fled after committing the crime, were arrested from Bihar.

The police, in its charge sheet filed before Additional Sessions Judge Sanjay Garg, said the evidence collected so far showed that the accused had raped the minor after kidnapping her and had left her confined in a room for two days.

Manoj and Pradeep have been chargesheeted under various provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act relating to aggravated sexual assault and for offences including kidnapping, procuring a minor girl, wrongful confinement, attempt to murder and destruction of evidence under the IPC.

The girl was rescued 40 hours later on April 17 and underwent treatment at AIIMS.

""The matter was thoroughly investigated for the offences in which the FIR was registered and which were added subsequently. The same set of facts attract two provisions of law i.e 376 D (sexual assault by a gang) and 377 (unnatural offences) of the IPC on the one hand and section 6 of POSCO Act on the other hand.

""The POCSO Act is a special act where the accused is required to prove innocence. So keeping in view the facts that the special law will always prevail over general law, this charge sheet is being prepared only for the offences under 363, 366A, 342, 307, 201 of the IPC and various sections of the POCSO Act,"" the police said in the charge sheet.

According to the National Crime Record Bureau, Delhi is the most unsafe for women, with the highest number of rape cases reported in the city last year. 

Of the 52 cities, Delhi had the highest number of rape cases with 585 incidents reported last year, up 132 since 2011. For the same period, Mumbai recorded 232 cases of rape, Jaipur 134, followed by Indore and Bhopal at 125 and 114 respectively.

Last year, the safest city was Tiruchirapalli with seven incidents of rapes recorded.

At the state level, Madhya Pradesh had the worst record with 3,425 cases of rape- a figure pointing to a dismal average of almost 10 women being assaulted every day. Rajasthan was the second most dangerous state for women with 2049 incidents of rape. West Bengal followed with 2046 recorded incidents.

Another alarming find was that in the last two years, the number of incidents of crimes against women across the country has gone up by almost 16,000.

As per NCRB's report, 30,942 cases of crimes against women were recorded in the state of West Bengal. Andhra Pradesh with 28,171 incidents had the second highest numbers, while Uttar Pradesh followed with 23,569 incidents.

Within a week of the alleged gang-rape of a 30-year-old US national in Manali, police have filed a chargesheet against the three accused, all drivers of Nepali nationality, an officer said today.

The chargesheet was filed against the accused in the court of Civil Judge-cum-Judicial Magistrate Gaurav Sharma in Manali yesterday, Superintendent of Police Vinod Dhawan told IANS on phone.

The three accused, who were arrested two days after the crime, are currently in judicial remand till June 17.

The woman who reached Manali, some 500 km from the national capital Delhi, with three other women just a day before the crime, alleged that she was repeatedly raped by three men who offered her lift in a vehicle early June 4 when she could not find a taxi on the outskirts of Manali.

Police said the men drove the woman to a secluded spot to rape and rob her.

Earlier, counsel for the accused had refused for the identification parade of the trio in front of the victim.

Mr Dhawan said a report from the state forensic science laboratory is awaited and would be submitted later in the court.

The accused have been charged with rape, abduction and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The Delhi High Court on Wednesday issued notice to police on a plea of Haryana's former minister Gopal Goyal Kanda's employee Aruna Chaddha against the framing of fresh charge of abetment of rape against her in the Geetika suicide case.

Justice G.P. Mittal also summoned trial court records, thereby suspending the proceedings before the trial judge till May 30.

The trial court had framed charges of abetting rape and suicide of Geetika against Chaddha.

Chaddha and Kanda have been charged with rape, abetment of rape, abetment of suicide, criminal conspiracy, forgery under the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act for hacking computers and sending offensive or false messages.

Geetika, 23, a former flight attendant in Kanda's now-defunct MDLR Airlines, was found hanging from the ceiling of a room at her Ashok Vihar house in north Delhi August 5 last year.

She left behind two suicide notes blaming Kanda and Chaddha for ruining her life. Both are now in judicial custody and have denied any involvement in the suicide.

New Delhi:
An accused in the gang-rape case of a 23-year-old girl in Delhi onboard a moving bus on December 16 has been vomiting blood as his ""food was being poisoned"" over several weeks in Tihar Jail, his lawyer told a fast-track court today, adding that he was critically ill.

Additional Sessions Judge directed Tihar Jail authorities to ensure that proper medical care is given to him.

The accused, Vinay Sharma, was admitted to Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, where he was taken from Tihar Jail with high fever. He has not attended court proceedings since May 8 due to his health issues.

His counsel told the court that Vinay has been hospitalised and is in a ""critical condition"". He added that the accused was not getting proper treatment in hospital as the doctors were on strike.

The court asked the jail authorities to find out whether the doctors were on strike and to inform it if Vinay could be shifted to a private hospital where better facilities are available.

The judge in the order said: ""The jail superintendent is directed to look into the matter. If doctors are on strike then make arrangements to shift the accused Vinay to another hospital where better facilities are available.""

""See if he can be shifted to any other private hospital. Tell me if as per jail manual, I can send him to another hospital at government expense.""

On the other hand, Special Public Prosecutor Dayan Krishnan denied Vinay's counsel's claims saying the doctors were on strike only for a few hours.

The court yesterday rejected Vinay's 15-day interim bail plea for his medical treatment.

He is being tried in December 16 gang rape case among others.

The 23-year-old woman was brutally tortured and gang-raped in the bus by five men and a juvenile. She died nine days later in a Singapore hospital.

The juvenile is facing proceedings before a Juvenile Justice Board, while the four other accused were put up for trial in the fast track court. One of the accused allegedly committed suicide in jail.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court has ruled that an interview given to a private news channel by the software engineer who was with a 23-year-medical student when she was gang-raped in a moving bus on December 16 last year, cannot be used as evidence in the trial.

The top court has put aside a Delhi High Court order which had allowed the use of a CD of the interview, telecast on January 4 this year, as evidence. The Delhi Police had appealed against the High Court order, submitting that the TV interview was inadmissible.

The Dellhi High Court had on March 7 allowed the plea of two of the six men accused in the gang-rape - Ram Singh, who allegedly committed suicide in Tihar jail, and his brother Mukesh against a trial court order which disallowed them from exhibiting the CD as evidence.

On December 16 last year, the young woman was brutally gang-raped and assaulted in a moving bus in south Delhi by six men. She died in a Singapore hospital on December 29. The male friend who was with her through the gruesome incident and was also attacked, is the only eye-witness in the case.

The survivng adult men being tried by a fast-track court in the case are Mukesh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Singh. The sixth accused, who has been declared a minor, is being tried by the Juvenile Justice Board.

The trial court had framed charges against the five adult accused under various sections of the IPC for gangrape and murder, apart from other charges. Ram Singh was found hanging in his Tihar Jail cell on March 11.

Rtunjya Gujral a 14- year-old student from Pathways World School in Gurgaon.
New Delhi:
Rtunjya Gujral,  is a 14- year-old student from Pathways World School in Gurgaon. She describes herself as a ""budding musician, artist and writer.""

The women of Delhi once used to be independent and free. But since the fatal gang rape case in December, I see insecurity and fear in everyone. I know people who have since placed curfew hours for their daughters, and some have even appointed bodyguards for their security, even my own father.

The guard appointed by my father accompanies me everywhere. He comes with my mother to drop and pick me up from school, and even when I'm meeting my friends or just going for a walk.

But is this the way we want to live? I don't. Even though I want my independence back, I am scared to go out alone without one of my parents. This is, in my opinion, very sad, because so much fear affects everyone's lives in different ways. I, being a young and growing girl, need to go out and play, but with all this happening to young girls practically every day, I am scared to go out, and my parents are scared to send me. On numerous occasions, I have caught grown men staring at me, making me extremely uncomfortable, and I wouldn't know what to do about it, so I was left with no choice but to avert my eyes.

When I saw the news on December 17th after having a very nice dinner with my family, I was shocked out of my wits. I didn't know someone could do something that barbaric to anyone.  Every day I came back from school and I turned my television on, in hopes of seeing those animals getting punished, all I saw were vain attempts from the public to get justice for the student, and violent attempts from the police to ""control"" the protests. I saw the politician making that horrible comment about the rape being the girl's fault, and it angered me to no limits. ""How could someone be that heartless?"" I asked my mother, she told me, ""Yeh India hai, beta. Nobody cares here.""

I found out through Facebook that she had passed on, and I immediately went online to read about it.

I had only just come out of that shock, when the news channel started saying things about ""our children being unsafe.""  A five-year-old girl kidnapped and raped, accused on the run. When I heard what that man did to her, I started crying. I was disgusted, how could anyone do that to such a small child?

What made me feel even worse was the fact that history was repeating itself. I was watching the Delhi gang-rape protest all over again. I saw the debates all over again, and all this made me wonder if this would ever take us anywhere. I wondered if everyone would stay angry for another two weeks and then go back to their normal lives. I wondered if four months from now some other innocent girl would have her life ruined before it even started. I wondered if it was all really worth it. I still don't know the answer to my question, but I know this. She didn't deserve it, nor did anyone else.

New Delhi:
The five-year-old who was kept captive and raped in a room below where her family lives will spend another two weeks in hospital, doctors have said.

One of the two men arrested from Bihar for her attack has allegedly provided the police with chilling details of how she was assaulted.

The police say that Manoj Kumar, who rented the room where the child was kept prisoner, has revealed that on April 15, he was drinking and watching porn on a mobile phone at the home of his friend Pradeep Kumar, 19, also from Bihar. The two men then travelled to where Manoj had recently rented a room in East Delhi.

They spotted the child playing there and bought a chocolate to lure her into Manoj's room, according to the police. They then took turns raping her. The police say that Manoj asked Pradeep to strangle the girl. Manoj reportedly waited outside while Pradeep went into the room to kill her. When he emerged, Pradeep said the child had died and the two men caught a train to Bihar.

Manoj was arrested three days later. Pradeep was caught yesterday in Bihar and brought to Delhi. He reportedly told the police he had made ""a big mistake.""

The child lay bleeding and without food or water in the locked room till Wednesday evening, when her mother heard her cries and summoned the police. Her husband claims that the police, who had been reluctant to help him, then offered him a bribe of Rs 2,000 to buy his silence about his daughter's ordeal.

The assault and the police's reaction has driven new street protests in Delhi, a smaller version of the massive demonstrations in December that followed the fatal gang-rape of a medical student on a moving bus.

The outrage pressured the government to introduce tougher new anti-rape laws.

New Delhi:
Delhi has witnessed a surge in crime against women this year with rape cases recording 158 per cent rise while molestation and eve-teasing incidents went up by 600 and over 700 per cent, respectively.

According to statistics released by Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar today, the national capital reported 463 rape cases this year till April 15 as against 179 during the same period last year.

While molestation cases showed 600 per cent rise this year (from 139 to 973 cases), eve teasing cases increased by 783.67 per cent (from 49 to 433 cases).

Police Commissioner Kumar used this figures to explain that police is proactively taking up the complaints of women.

""This shows that the tendency earlier of dissuading women complainants has dramatically changed post-December 16 (gang rape),"" he said.

He also said 85 per cent of rape cases this year have been cracked while the figures for molestation and eve teasing are 86 and 95.8 per cent.

""Is it humanely possible for police to prevent a case like this (the rape of five-year-old girl) when somebody lures a girl into a room (and rape her)? Rapes are opportunistic crimes confined to private space.

""97 per cent of rapes are committed in houses. Only three per cent of rapes are committed by strangers,"" he said.

Kumar said this year 178 rape accused were lovers or friends of victims while 115 were found to be neighbours, 15 employers or co-workers, 12 family members, 10 fathers and two step fathers, nine husbands and ex-husbands, nine brothers-in-law and two fathers-in-law, eight landlords and three tenants.

Besides, cousins, teachers, doctors and tantriks were also found to be involved in such crimes.

New Delhi:
The five-year-old whose rape in Delhi has triggered large street protests and new promises of  ""action not words"" from the government is slowly healing and should be able to go home in two weeks, said doctors attending to her at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

This morning, a second man named Pradeep Kumar was arrested for her rape in Bihar, where the original suspect, Manoj Kumar, was picked up over the weekend and brought to Delhi.

Manoj Kumar had said Pradeep had taken part in the savage attack. Today, Pradeep described the crime as a ""big mistake"". (Read)

The five-year-old was kidnapped on Monday last week while she was playing outside her home. She was discovered on Wednesday evening, battered and bleeding, in a tiny room below her home, where she had been kept hostage, starved, tortured and raped.

The police's many lapses in the case have driven protesters to the streets since Friday, with regular demonstrations outside the Police Headquarters in Delhi, and the homes of the Prime Minister and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

The girl's parents allege that when they reported her missing, police officers refused to help, and when she was found by neighbours, cops offered them Rs 2,000 to buy their silence.

The outrage is reminiscent of protests that swept the capital in December after a 23-year-old student was savagely gang-raped on a moving bus. She died nearly two weeks later.

Lakhi Sarai/New Delhi:
A 19-year-old boy was arrested from Bihar today for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl in Delhi which he described as a ""big mistake"", two days after the first accused, Manoj Kumar, was apprehended in the case.

Pradeep Kumar (19) was nabbed from his maternal uncle's house in Barahiya village in Bihar's Lakhi Sarai by a joint police team from Delhi and Bihar and sent to transit remand for 15 days by a court there, police said.

Pradeep's name surfaced in the case on the basis of interrogation of his friend and prime accused Manoj Kumar (22) who was apprehended from his in-laws' house in Bihar's Muzaffarpur on Saturday.

""We have got information from (our team in) Bihar that Pradeep has confessed to the crime. He is an illiterate,"" Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar told reporters in Delhi.

Pradeep said, ""I have committed a big mistake,"" as he was escorted by police.

Police sources said they have now invoked the sections concerning gang-rape in the case.

Bihar Director General of Police Abhayanand said Pradeep was produced before Lakhisarai Chief Judicial Magistrate Vishnu Dev Upadhay who sent him to transit remand. He is being brought to Delhi.

A large crowd had gathered near the court and the police had a tough time in controlling it.

He had fled from capital on April 15 after allegedly raping the girl, fearing that she was dead after they strangled her.

Though Pradeep refused to divulge the sequence of events, police sources said Manoj told interrogators that Pradeep came to his house in east Delhi's Gandhi Nagar on April 15 evening and they had consumed alcohol.

Manoj claimed that Pradeep insisted on bringing a girl to the house and he went out and lured the five-year-old girl living in the same building with a chocolate, sources said.

Manoj also told police that he did not sexually assault the girl and it was Pradeep who committed rape, they said.

He had also claimed that they fled from the house after strangling her fearing that she will tell her parents about the crime they committed. They also thought she was dead, sources added.

Superintendent of Police of Lakhisarai district Rajeev Mishra, who interrogated him, said Pradeep has ""admitted"" to his crime.

Pradeep belongs to Ahiyapur in Sheikhupura district of Bihar, Additional Director General of Police (ADGP) of Bihar Ravindra Kumar said. He left his native place for Delhi four years ago and he was working as a mason, he added.

He came in contact with Manoj in Delhi and they became friends. In his native Sheikhpura, locals alleged that he was in the habit of harassing girls and was beaten up by residents many a times in this regard.

A senior Delhi Police official said once Pradeep is brought to Delhi, he will be confronted with Manoj to verify the claims made by the latter.

Pradeep Kumar's sister-in-law Kajal Devi and Sheikhpura ward council member Shahbaz Khan claimed the youth was arrested earlier in a sex related case.

""He (Pradeep) should be hanged for what he has done,"" Kajal Devi told reporters.

She said two years back, Pradeep was charged with harassing a girl when he was working at a private hotel in Patna. Pradeep studied up to class VIII, she added.

New Delhi:
Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Monday said an all-party meeting should be held to suggest amendments to tackle any shortcomings in the anti-rape law and also called for death penalty in cases of barbaric rapes.

Participating in a discussion in the Rajya Sabha on issues relating to safety of women, Mayawati said that despite a stringent anti-rape law brought in the first half of the budget session, cases of rape were on the rise.

""We should not feel hesitant to bring in amendments... we should call an all-party meeting to tackle any shortcomings in the law,"" said the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister.

""The government should be firm and bring in the amendments in this session so that such incidents don't take place,"" said Mayawati referring to the barbaric rape of a five-year-old in the capital last week.

She said incidences of rape are publicized in Delhi due to an active media and the government's attention is drawn to it. ""But besides Delhi, rapes are taking place elsewhere too,"" she said, urging members to rise above petty party politics to tackle the issue and think about how to improve the police department.

""Instances of depravity are increasing in society... it is the joint responsibility of the government and society to tackle this,"" she said.

She suggested that among the amendments to the anti-rape law could be to fix a time-frame to decide cases and ""nothing less than death penalty"" in cases of brutal rape.

While giving clearance to entertainment programmes, like films, and advertisements, the government should keep Indian culture and traditions in mind, she urged.

Mayawati also alleged that rapes and crimes against women had increased manifold in Uttar Pradesh and urged that president's rule be imposed in the state.

New Delhi:
Arvind Kejriwal, founder of the new Aam Aadmi Party, wants Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Delhi Police chief Neeraj Kumar to quit over last week's rape of a five-year-old in Delhi.

Mr Kejriwal's call for their resignation came after Mr Kumar ruled out his resignation. ""If resigning would help, I would resign 1000 times,"" he said.

Since Friday, Mr Kejriwal's party has been among the groups organizing protests at different parts of Delhi including the Police Headquarters to shame the police for its alleged apathy and attempt to cover up the case by offering a bribe to the child's father.

The demonstrations over the weekend echo the much larger protests that followed the brutal gang-rape of a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi in December.

At that time, the government pledged it would place women's safety at the top of its agenda.   The police said it would train its officers to improve how they handle cases of sexual violence.

Mr Kejriwal's party has claimed that its focus on the five-year-old's case forced an unwilling police to follow up on her father's complaint that she was missing, and helped move her from an East Delhi hospital to the better-equipped AIIMS, where she is now reported to be stable.

The five-year-old went missing April 15 and was found two days later in a locked room in the same building where she lives with her family. The girl was alone when she was found, having been left for dead by her attackers, police say. Her mother heard her cries. The police admits it did not search the house.

New Delhi:
Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde has said an inquiry has been ordered into Delhi Police lapses in investigating the disappearance of the five-year-old girl who was found brutally raped, and attempts to hush up the matter later.

In a statement tabled in the Lok Sabha amid din, Mr Shinde said the station house officer (SHO) and the investigating officer (IO) have been placed under suspension, taking note of the lapses in the investigation.

""The joint CP (commissioner of police) (vigilance) has been asked to conduct an inquiry. The joint CP (vigilance) shall also inquire into the allegation that the local police paid some money to the father of the victim to hush up the case,"" Mr Shinde said in the statement.

The victim's parents had alleged that some police personnel had offered them Rs.2,000 and told them to keep quiet over the issue.

Mr Shinde said the two accused have been arrested in connection with the case. Both were arrested from Bihar.

Medical examination of the first accused, arrested from Muzaffarpur district of Bihar on April 19, has been conducted for DNA, he said.

The minor girl was initially admitted at the Swami Dayanand Hospital in Shahdara, east Delhi.

He said: ""Some protestors were holding demonstration at the Dayanand Hospital where the minister concerned of Delhi government was visiting to enquire about the health of the child along with the local MP. A few protestors tried to break through the police cordon around the hospital in order to enter the premises.""

""One ACP (assistant commissioner of police) rank officer was seen on camera slapping one of the lady protesters. The ACP has been placed under immediate suspension,"" he said.

The raped five-year-old child was later shifted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

The girl was reported missing on April 15 from Gandhi Nagar. She was found on April 17 after her mother heard cries for help from a locked-up room in the building where the family lived.

Mr Shinde said, ""Preliminary medico legal case (MLC) examination confirms sexual assault of the brutal kind.""

The capital has witnessed widespread protest over the incident.

New Delhi:
For the fourth day in a row, there were street protests in Delhi against the rape of a five-year-old who was kidnapped and tortured by a man who rented a small room in the same building where she lived with her family.

The child is recovering at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

The demonstrations today at AIIMS and the Police Headquarters were fronted largely by the opposition BJP and the fledgling Aam Aadmi Party founded by Arvind Kejriwal. Women's groups organised a protest at Jantar Mantar; some demonstrators tried to force their way past the barricades there. They wanted to march to Parliament, where there was an uproar over the crime and law-makers debated the recent slew of sexual attacks against women and young girls.

Three Metro stations - Race Course Road, Central Secretariat and Udyog Bhavan - were shut down to prevent large groups from gathering near the Prime Minister's residence. (Read)

Since December, when a student was fatally gang-raped on a moving bus in the capital, the safety of women has been brutally placed on the national political agenda a year before elections. (Read: Foreign media on sexual assault of children in India)

Acknowledging the anger expressed by many online and in streets, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said on Sunday that it is imperative for the police to show ""concern and sensitivity while dealing with public anxiety that such incidents generate.""

Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in a statement to Parliament has said that an enquiry has been ordered to determine if police officials initially refused to help search for the five-year-old, and then offered a bribe to her parents to buy their silence when she was found three days after she was kidnapped.

Two men who belong to Bihar have been arrested for the savage assault.

Delhi's increasing reputation as an unsafe city is inviting some criticism from the sporting community as well. The spate of rape cases and the inability of the administration to provide safety to women of all ages is now scaring a 'world' citizen like Saina Nehwal.

The London Olympics bronze medalist is scheduled to play the Indian Open Grand Prix badminton championship in Delhi later this week and it's a (unhappy) coincidence that last time she was in the Capital for the same tournament, the city was grappling with a rape case.

In a statement on Monday, Saina said: ""Last time, I came to Delhi there was a rape incident and again there is rape. I am very sad and upset with what is happening in Delhi. Something must be done immediately to stop this.""

A Haryana girl, Saina lives in Hyderabad with her parents. If she means what she says, it is unlikely that Saina will venture out on the streets once her matches are over at the Siri Fort sports complex.

""After what I am hearing (of the rapes), it is really very scaring. I will think twice (about walking alone in Delhi). This can happen to me as well. It is very unfortunate. Delhi is a beautiful city but such incidents have truly tarnished its image,"" Saina said.

As many as 220 players from 18 countries will be participating in the Indian Open in Delhi from April 23 to 28. Saina and PV Sindhu will be India's medal hopes in the women's singles section.

Parliament erupts over Delhi rape case; Rajya Sabha debates safety of women

New Delhi:
The Rajya Sabha is discussing security for women, not very far from where angry demonstrations are being held in New Delhi to protest against the brutal rape of a five-year-old girl last week.

Leaders from different parties, including Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, have expressed concern that despite Parliament enacting tougher laws against sexual assault on women recently, incidents of brutal crime have only increased. As the Upper House debates the issue, four minor girls are in hospital in different parts of India; they were raped and subjected to unspeakable violation by their assailants.

This is the first time since this morning that the Upper House has settled for discussion. In an effort to ensure that the Rajya Sabha functions, Chairman Hamid Ansari had earlier in the day offered structured debates on all issues that a belligerent opposition wants to raise.

The BJP and other parties like the AIADMK have demanded a discussion today on the allegation that Law Minister Ashwani Kumar and members of the Prime Minister's Office changed the status report that the CBI submitted in the Supreme Court on the coal allocation scam investigation last month. They have demanded the presence in House of Mr Kumar, who is a Rajya Sabha member of the Congress.

The Lok Sabha has been adjourned for the day; the Lower House too saw continuous ruckus by Opposition MPs over the Delhi rape case and other issues like the coal scam and the joint parliamentary committee draft report that gives a clean chit to the Prime Minister and Finance Minister P Chidambaram in the 2G telecom scam.

Just before Parliament resumed for the rest of the Budget session this morning, the Prime Minister said, ""It's my sincere wish that the House is allowed to function. We have many important bills to discuss.""

The BJP and the Left have said that in both the coal scam and the telecom or 2G scam, the government has engineered deceit to defend the Prime Minister.

""The government has forfeited the right to seek cooperation,"" said BJP leader Arun Jaitley to NDTV today. (Watch)

In the first part of the Budget session, the PM's minority government lost its second-biggest member, the DMK.

It needs all the numbers it can cobble up to pass several money Bills, including the Finance Bill, and other key legislation like the Land Acquisition Bill, Food Security Bill, Insurance and Pensions Bills.

New Delhi:
For the fourth day in a row, activists, students and political workers organised protests against the rape of a five-year-old who was kidnapped and tortured by a man who rented a small room in the same building where she lived with her family.

The child is recovering at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

Protesters tried to force their way past barricades at Jantar Mantar, the designated area for demonstrations in Delhi. Protesters want to march up to Parliament which has reconvened for the second half of its budget session.

The public anger is reminiscent of the furore that filled the street after the fatal gang-rape of a student on a moving bus in Delhi in December. (Read: Foreign media on sexual assault of children in India) Over the weekend, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said it is imperative for the police to show ""concern and sensitivity while dealing with public anxiety that such incidents generate.""

Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde in a statement to Parliament has said that an enquiry has been ordered to determine if police officials initially refused to help search for the child, and then offered a bribe to her parents to buy their silence when she was found three days after she was kidnapped.

Two men who belong to Bihar have been arrested for the savage assault.

Three Metro stations - Race Course Road, Central Secretariat and Udyog Bhavan - close to Parliament, India Gate and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's residence have been shut down. (Read)

Another group of protestors were at the Police Headquarters, demanding the removal of Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar.

Traffic jams were reported in some areas near India Gate in the heart of the city.

New Delhi:
Protesters gathered at Delhi Police Headquarters for the third day today demanding removal of Commissioner Neeraj Kumar and justice for the five-year-old rape victim even as police put up barricades to prevent December-like protests near Parliament where traffic was disrupted.

Three Metro stations -- Race Course Road, Central Secretariat and Udyog Bhavan -- close to Parliament, India Gate and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's residence were closed for public anticipating anti-rape protests.

The measures came against the backdrop of re-convening of the Budget session today.

However, in the morning hours, there were no protests at AIIMS like in the past three days.

Chaos was witnessed near Parliament as police closed Red Cross Road, Rafi Marg, Raisina Road and some crossings on Rajpath. There was trouble for vehicular movement near India Gate also as barricades were erected on Mansingh Road.

Caught unawares, many commuters coming from south Delhi had to take long winding routes to reach Connaught Place and nearby localities.

Long queues of vehicles were seen on many arterial roads leading to India Gate.

A handful of BJP and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) activists restarted their protest this morning outside the Police Headquarters near the busy ITO which was barricaded. A large number of police personnel were deployed at the Police Headquarters (PHQ).

Barricades were setup on the roads leading to Parliament, near the Central Secretariat metro station, India Gate and near the Delhi Police Headquarters in ITO, to prevent any incident.

Pradeep Kumar, arrested from Bihar
New Delhi:
The five-year-old whose rape in Delhi has triggered large street protests and new promises of ""action not words"" from the government is slowly healing and should be able to go home in two weeks, said doctors attending to her at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

This morning, a second man named Pradeep Kumar was arrested for her rape in Bihar, where the original suspect, Manoj Kumar, was picked up over the weekend and brought to Delhi.

Manoj Kumar said Pradeep had taken part in the savage attack.

With more demonstrations planned in the streets today, two metro stations in central Delhi have been closed to prevent large groups from reaching the PM's house.

The five-year-old was kidnapped on Monday last week while she was playing outside her home. She was discovered on Wednesday evening, battered and bleeding, in a tiny room below her home, where she had been kept hostage, starved, tortured and raped.

The police's many lapses in the case have driven protestors to the streets since Friday, with regular demonstrations outside the Police Headquarters in Delhi, and the homes of the Prime Minister and Congress President Sonia Gandhi.

The girl's parents allege that when they reported her missing, police officers refused to help, and when she was found by neighbours, cops offered them Rs 2,000 to buy their silence.

The outrage is reminiscent of protests that swept the capital in December after a 23-year-old student was savagely gang-raped on a moving bus. She died nearly two weeks later.

People protesting against the rape in Delhi
New Delhi:
A second man has been arrested from Bihar in the brutal rape of a five-year-old girl in New Delhi. Doctors at the capital's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said the child's fever is down, antibiotics are working and that she is on a semi-solid diet. They also said she will probably have to stay in hospital for another two weeks.

The Delhi and Bihar police conducted a joint operation to arrest a man named Pradeep from Barhaya in Lakhisarai district, after Manoj Kumar - the man accused of kidnapping and holding the child hostage as he violated her - allegedly told the police that he had an accomplice. Manoj Kumar had reportedly also said this in a Bihar court soon after he was apprehended from his hometown Muzaffarpur on Saturday.

The Delhi Police will request a Lakhisarai court to allow them to bring Pradeep to the capital, where, sources said, the two men will be made to confront with each other.

If Pradeep's involvement in the heinous crime is confirmed, both men will be charged with gang-rape, the sources said.

The five-year-old was kidnapped on Monday last week while she was playing outside her home, and was then kept captive in the basement of the same building where she lived allegedly by Manoj, who rented a room there about a week ago.

She was reported missing the same day, but was found only two days later, not by the police, but neighbours who heard her cries.

The attack on the child was barbarous - she was violated with pieces of a candle and a bottle. She was taken to hospital in a critical condition, but is recovering well now doctors said.

There is growing anger on the streets of Delhi over the savage rape. There have been protests by citizen groups and members of Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Roads were blocked and traffic was disrupted at the busy ITO junction yesterday. Prohibitory orders have been imposed at India Gate.

New Delhi:
The 22-year-old man who kidnapped, brutally raped and mutilated a five-year-old girl in Delhi earlier this week has told the Delhi Police that another person was involved in the crime, sources have told NDTV.

The accused, Manoj Kumar, had even claimed this in a Bihar court after he was apprehended from hometown Muzaffarpur yesterday, sources said.

The Delhi Police has, however, denied arresting or looking for the second accused in the case.

Manoj will be produced in a Delhi court tomorrow.

He had recently married and his wife had left for Muzzafarpur a few days before the crime. He had fled to his hometown thinking the girl had died, said police. They tracked Manoj by tracing his mobile phone.

The five-year-old was kidnapped on Monday while she was playing outside her home, and was then kept captive in the basement of the same building where she lived by a man who rented a room there about a week ago. On Wednesday evening, it was not the police but neighbours who found her after they heard her cries.

The attack on the girl was barbarous - she was violated with pieces of a candle and a bottle. She is currently conscious, stable and alert, according to the doctors treating her at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). (Read: Five-year-old stable, say doctors)

There is growing anger on the streets of Delhi over the savage rape. There is much anger towards the Delhi Police as well after the father of the five-year-old alleged that that not only were the police unable to find his daughter for three days, but that when she was rescued by neighbours, the cops offered him Rs. 2000 to buy his silence. He was allegedly told to be grateful that his daughter was still alive.

Activists yesterday protested outside the Delhi Police Headquarters alleging the cops had failed to act in the case. They demanded that Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar resign, saying he ""failed to tackle the rape crimes"" in the city.

Pressure is also mounting on the police after Assistant Commissioner of Police BS Ahlawat was on Friday caught on camera slapping a woman protester, who was demanding justice for the girl. While the ACP has been suspended, since then many have been demanding that he be arrested and prosecuted for his brazen show of strength. Protesters are scheduled to gather at the India Gate later this evening to demand his arrest.

New Delhi:
On the second day of protests in Delhi over the savage rape of a five-year-old girl, Congress President Sonia Gandhi issued a strong statement. ""Action and not words required to check incidents like this heinous rape of five-year-old girl,"" she said.

Mrs Gandhi visited the girl and her family at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

Her comments come hours after the Prime Minister said that the tragedy had ""deeply disturbed him"" and ordered immediate action against police officers who were seen on camera slapping a woman protester yesterday. (Read Prime Minister's full statement)

The government's response this time is in sharp contrast to December when it was attacked for failing to acknowledge the frustration and anger in the country after a medical student was gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi.

The outrage in Delhi over the horrific attack on the little girl is provoked partly because her father alleges that not only were the police unable to find her for three days, but that when she was rescued by neighbours, the cops offered him Rs 2000 to buy his silence.

There were protests today outside the Delhi Police Headquarters where protesters alleged the cops had failed to act in the case. Holding up banners and shouting slogans against the government and police, some protesters tried to break barricades. (Read: Protesters try to break barricades) There were also protests at AIIMS where the five-year-old is reported to be in stable condition though the doctors warned the next 24 hours will be crucial for her.

The 22-year-old man who allegedly kidnapped and raped her was arrested from Muzaffarpur in Bihar late last night. (Read: Man accused of raping five-year-old arrested in Bihar)

New Delhi:
The Delhi Police has come under severe criticism after a five-year-old girl was raped and brutalised, allegedly by her neighbour. The girl was kidnapped on Monday from outside her home in east Delhi and was found two days later, not by the police, but her neighbours. After the case sparked huge protests outside the hospital, where the girl was admitted, a senior police officer was caught on camera slapping a woman demonstrator. The little girl's family has alleged that cops offered them Rs 2000 to stay quiet after it reported their child was missing.

LK Advani, senior BJP leader: In Delhi, the government sits idle as a heinous crime gets repeated sickeningly. Sushma Swaraj met the five-year-old girl today. We felt there will be some sort of restrictions after December (incident) but nothing has happened.

Sushma Swaraj, senior BJP leader and leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha: Delhi child rape case has shown that perversity and sadism is common to these criminals. These perverts and sadists require shock treatment. We need to make the recent law more stringent. Home Minister should convene a meeting of representatives of all political parties to provide for death sentence in cases of rape of children and cases involving brutality and barbarity as in the present case.

Brinda Karat, Politburo member, CPM: The Police have beaten those protesters and insulted them. So what is this happening? Is it a Police force or rowdy force or what is it? So it is not just about suspending. So a case must be ruled against them. This is a very shameful incident. It is a sad incident. And I don't know how many more sacrifices of girl children this Delhi Government wants. When will this city awaken? This is a question.

Smriti Irani, National Vice President, BJP: The press bringing out such incidents to the knowledge of the nation has become an everyday affair. Rape and murder of a six-year-old girl in Aligarh and the brutal rape of this small girl, makes me feel that the nation as a whole should approach the Indian government. I will also approach it and demand the time has come that people who rape minor girls be given nothing less than a death penalty.

Krishna Tirath, Women and Child Development Minister: With a small girl, such an incident happening is a very frightening matter. And I understand that for this the people need to think and deliberate about this and introspect because we are sensitising the Police. We are alerting them. The kind of incidents that occur in Delhi - police need to be attentive about it.

Manish Tewari, Information and Broadcating Minister: The incident which has taken place in Delhi is extremely saddening and condemnable. The Prime Minister has reacted with a strongly-worded statement.

Kiran Walia, Women and Child Welfare Minister, Delhi: I am not happy with the way Delhi Police has handled the case. They need to pull up their socks.

President Pranab Mukherjee: I am shocked and deeply anguished at the latest incident of sexual assault and rape of a five-year-old child in Delhi. I join her family in praying for a speedy recovery and call upon concerned authorities to ensure the best possible medical attention for her.

Prime Minister's Office (in a statement): The Prime Minister has been deeply disturbed to hear news of the shameful incident in which a 5 year-old child in Delhi was sexually abused and is now fighting for her life in hospital. The Prime Minister has also seen news visuals of the completely unacceptable treatment meted out by police officers to some women protesting against this incident. He has spoken to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi in this regard and has conveyed to him the need for the strictest possible action to be taken against the erring officials, as also for appropriate medical care being provided to the young victim of the sexual assault. The Prime Minister has once again reiterated the need for society to look deep within and work to root out the evil of rape and other such crimes from our midst.

New Delhi:
There was outrage in India today over the rape of a five-year-old girl in Delhi, who is now in critical condition in hospital.

The Delhi Police has suspended two officers for allegedly misbehaving with her father, who says he was offered Rs 2000 by cops to buy his silence.

""The Station House Officer of Gandhinagar, Dharampal Singh, and First Investigating Officer Mahavir Singh have been suspended pending enquiry because there are allegations that their behaviour with the family members was not appropriate,"" said Prabhakar, DCP, East Delhi, at a press conference this evening.

The statement is vastly inappropriate and insufficient for the gravity of the charges against the police.

The alleged rapist was arrested from Bihar late last night.

For three days, the child was kept locked up and assaulted by a neighbour in a basement just below her home. She was found on Wednesday evening not by the police but by other residents of the building. (Read: Delhi incensed, protests over five-year-old rape and police response)

The police today said though it had combed public parks in the neighbourhood, it did not think to search for the child in homes near her own because the family said it did not have any suspects.

This afternoon, while preparations were being made to move her from an East Delhi hospital to AIIMS, protestors shouted slogans and encircled politicians who met the family at Swami Dayanand Hospital.

A senior officer was filmed slapping a young woman demonstrator. (Watch | Read) He has been suspended.

New Delhi:
Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj today expressed concern over the brutal rape of a five-year-old in the national capital and police atrocities on some women protesting the incident.

""I am terribly shocked to know about the details of the rape of a 5-year-old child in Delhi. She should be shifted to AIIMS immediately,"" she said on micro-blogging site Twitter.

The girl, who was brutally raped and her organs mutilated, was shifted to AIIMS in the evening.

The BJP leader lamented that nothing much seems to have changed since the December 16 gangrape of a medical student and the police are still failing to protect women in the capital.

She pointed out that what is even worse is that the Delhi Police have hit out at the women protesting it.

""I had thought that after December 16 case, thinking will change. Unfortunately, the situation has worsened. I see an ACP slapping a young girl protesting against this. These policemen are incapable of protecting women. Instead they beat them up,"" Mrs Swaraj said.

""This ACP should be ashamed of his uniform,"" Mrs Swaraj said.

In the Delhi gangrape case, there were charges that the PCR van arrived late and policemen were undecided about which hospital the victim should be rushed to.

A five-year-old who was kept hostage, mutilated and raped by her neighbour, is fighting for her life at Delhi's famous AIIMS hospital.

The barbarous attack on her - she was violated with pieces of a candle and a bottle - has outraged the city. Through Friday, protestors shouted slogans against politicians and the police at the hospital where she was being treated in East Delhi till she was moved to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

Doctors at AIIMS say she is now conscious, but still in critical condition.

The man who attacked her is missing. Doctors who treated the child said her injuries show he tried to strangle her.

""This is the first time that I have seen such barbarism with a five-year-old,"" said RK Bansal, medical superintendent of Swami Dayanand Hospital.

She was kidnapped on Monday while she was playing outside her home, and was then kept captive in the basement of the same building where she lived by a man who rented a room there about a week ago. On Wednesday evening, it was not the police but neighbours who found her after they heard her cries.

Offering a weak defense, the police said that it searched public parks in the neighbourhood, but did not think to search the many rooms in the building where the family lived.

Her father says the police offered him Rs. 2000 ""to keep quiet"". He said they advised him, ""Thank God that she has been found alive."" The Delhi Police has suspended two officers for allegedly behaving inappropriately with the child's parents. (Read) 

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said that he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the ""shameful incident"". (Read)

Since December, when the fatal gang-rape of a student on a Delhi bus stunned and incensed the country, the city's police and government have vowed that no effort will be spared to protect women. But a slew of attacks, many of them against young girls, prove that despite the introduction of tougher anti-rape laws and pledges of better policing, little has changed for a city titled ""the rape capital"" of India.

New Delhi:
A man, who had trespassed the house of his physically challenged neighbour in the night and molested his minor daughter while she was sleeping, has been sentenced to two year imprisonment by a Delhi court.

""Convict Pradeep Kumar committed trespass in the dead of the night in the neighbour's house for assaulting the minor,"" Metropolitan Magistrate Ekta Gauba said while handing down the jail term and also a fine of Rs 5,000.

The court denied Kumar's plea for release on probation saying he ""did not deserve it"" as ""offence against women are on rise in the city, and it is a serious public order problem if the women are not safe in their own houses in the night.""

30-year-old Kumar, a resident of west Delhi and a plumber by profession, was caught by victim's mother and her physically challenged father while he was trying to flee after molesting the minor.

He was convicted for trespassing and sexually assaulting the girl.

The girl's mother in her complaint to the police had said that on October 7, 2011, she and her family were sleeping in the same room when they were woken up by screams of their 16-year-old daughter and saw a scantily-clad Kumar trying to flee from the balcony. She said she and her husband managed to nab Kumar and reported the matter to the police.

The victim told the court that on the night of the incident, while she was in a deep sleep, she felt someone touching her inappropriately.

She said when she woke up, she saw Kumar misbehaving with her and screamed at which he ran towards balcony but was nabbed by her parents.

New Delhi:
A five-year-old who was kept hostage, mutilated and raped by her neighbour, is fighting for her life in Delhi. The barbarous attack on her - she was violated with pieces of a candle and a bottle - have outraged the city, triggering large protests against politicians and the police at the hospital where she was being treated.

The man who mutilated her has been identified by the police, who say that he belongs to Muzaffarnagar. Police teams have now been sent to the town in Uttar Pradesh to track him. He had moved just eight days ago into the room that he rented in a building in East Delhi where the child and her family also stayed.

This evening, the child was moved at her family's request from an East Delhi hospital to the city's famous All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).

""This is the first time that I have seen such barbarism with a five-year-old,"" said RK Bansal, a doctor who treated her before she was moved. The child went missing on Monday evening while she was playing near her home and was found on Wednesday evening, battered and bleeding in the basement.

It was not the police who found her. Neighbours who heard her cries broke into the locked room. By then, the abductor had disappeared.

Offering a weak defense, the police said that it searched public parks in the neighbourhood, but did not think to search the many rooms in the building where the family lived.

When she was found, her father says the police offered him Rs. 2000 ""to keep quiet"". He said they advised him, ""Thank God that she has been found alive."" (Read)

Those allegations and the police's insistence that it had acted promptly to help the family left protesters seething at the Swami Dayanand hospital where the child was admitted after she was found.

A police officer was caught on camera slapping a woman demonstrator; he has been suspended. (Watch) The protesters, many of who belonged to Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party, targeted politicians who visited the hospital, shouting angry slogans. A Delhi minister's car was vandalised.

Since December, when the fatal gang-rape of a student on a Delhi bus stunned and incensed the country, the city's police and government have vowed that no effort will be spared to protect women.

New Delhi:
Two defendants in the New Delhi gang-rape and murder trial on Thursday claimed they were not in the bus on which the 23-year-old student was repeatedly raped, the Press Trust of India said.

Accused Vinay Sharma and Pawan Gupta made the plea before a special fast-track court hearing the trial in the capital, reported the PTI news agency.

""Vinay's mobile contains a video recording and photos which can establish that he and Pawan were not in the bus on the night of incident,"" the agency quoted defence lawyer AP Singh as telling the judge.

Sharma and Gupta were attending a musical night along with a third friend in their neighbourhood who could be a crucial witness in the case, the counsel said, accusing the police of ""falsely implicating"" them in the case.

The pair, arrested along with four others shortly after the crime on December 16, have been charged with gang-rape, robbery and murder following the death of the physiotherapy student.

Last month, the main accused in the case and the driver of the bus used in the assault was found dead hanging in his prison cell.

The case has led to months of soul-searching over widespread sexual crime in India, and resulted in tougher laws to punish rapists and focused global attention on violence against women in the country.

New Delhi:
Vinay Sharma, one of the five adult men accused of raping a medical student on a bus in Delhi last December, was produced at the fast track court hearing the case with a fractured right hand today. His lawyer has alleged that Vinay was beaten up ""by other inmates and police officials"" at Tihar Jail, where he is lodged.

The lawyer, AP Singh, also said outside court, ""Vinay was supposed to give exams for the Indian Air Force. His right hand is broken. He was transferred to the hospital and today he appeared in court with a fracture.""

Last month, Ram Singh, the driver of the bus in which the student was brutally raped and tortured by six men, was found hanging in his cell in Tihar. Jail authorities said he had committed suicide, but his family alleged that he had been murdered. The sixth attacker, a minor, is being tried by a juvenile court.

The lawyer also alleged today that another man accused in the case, Akshay Thakur, was assaulted in jail a few days ago. ""The situation is getting worse in the jail,"" Mr Singh said.

After Ram Singh's death, the lawyers of the other four accused lodged at Tihar, among them Ram Singh's brother, pleaded in court that their clients be shifted from the high-security Delhi prison as other inmates routinely abused and threatened them. The court had turned down the plea but asked the police and jail authorities to ensure that they were provided with adequate security.

A few months ago the police had given the men extra security on their way from prison to court for daily hearings in the case after allegedly intercepting calls that mentioned a threat to their life.

The 23-year-old paramedical student was gang-raped and thrown out of the moving bus in the heart of Delhi on December 16, 2012. She died of her grievous injuries 13 days later in a Singapore hospital. All the men have been charged with murder.

Rio De Janeiro:
Two foreign tourists were held for hours, brutalized and one of them sexually assaulted aboard a public transport van they boarded in Rio de Janeiro's showcase Copacabana beach neighbourhood, police said in a statement.

Two men aged 20 and 22 have been taken into custody and a third is being sought in connection with the incident, which saw the two foreigners held for around six hours starting shortly after midnight on Saturday, police said.

The statement said the suspects forced other passengers to get out of the van and then sexually assaulted the female tourist inside the vehicle, which was one of a fleet of vans that serve bus routes and seat about a dozen people. During the alleged assault, the tourists were driven to the poor suburban neighbourhood of Sao Goncalo, where the two suspects were apprehended, the statement said.

The victims' nationalities have not been released, but local media reports have said the woman is American. Reports said the two had been studying Portuguese in Rio for about a month and that both left the country following the incident.

The statement said one of the victims' cellphone was found in the suspects' possession. The suspects had also used a debit card belonging to one of the victims at two gas stations, the statement said.

The Globo television network broadcast surveillance camera images of two men filling up the white van and showed police images of a metal bar the suspects are thought to have used to beat and intimidate the victims.

The victims positively identified the two suspects, and a Brazilian woman has said she'd also been assaulted by the pair on March 23, the statement said.

In an interview with Globo television, commanding officer Alexandre Braga, who heads the Rio police unit specializing in crimes against tourists, said the suspects had gone on a sex crime spree.

""The characteristics of both crimes, both the Brazilian case and the one with the foreigners, lead us to believe that they (the suspects) wanted to have a 'party of evil,' in quotes,"" Braga said. ""The principal motive appears to have been the satisfaction of their lust.""

He added that the robbery and other crimes appear to have been ""secondary.""

Multiple calls to police seeking further detail Monday have not been returned.

The incident raises new questions about security in Rio, which has cracked down on once-endemic drug violence in preparation for hosting next year's soccer World Cup and the 2016 summer Olympic games. The city will also be playing host to World Youth Day, a Roman Catholic pilgrimage expected to draw some 2 million people in late July.

The attack also drew comparisons with the fatal December beating and gang rape of a young woman on a New Delhi bus. Six men beset a 23-year-old university student and male friend after they boarded a private bus, touching off a wave of protests across India demanding stronger protection for women.

In Brazil, more than 5,300 cases of sexual assault were reported between January and June 2012, according to the country's Health Ministry.

New Delhi:
Government has served show-cause notices to two senior IPS officers and several others asking them to explain why action should not be initiated against them for alleged dereliction of duty in connection with the December 16 gang-rape incident in New Delhi.

The show-cause notices were served against the then Delhi Police Special Commissioner (Operations) Deepak Mishra, the then Joint Commissioner (Traffic) Satyendra Garg besides a DCP and an Additional DCP (both IPS cadre) and two DANIPS officers, official sources said.

The police officers were asked to clarify why PCR vans could not be reached faster and why such system could not be developed so that there is no jurisdiction issue in registering any case, sources said.

They were also asked to explain lapses and why a departmental enquiry should not be initiated against them.

Efforts to reach Mishra and Garg did not yield any result.

Action has also been initiated against one senior DANICS officer posted as Secretary, State Transport Authority, Delhi government. One inspector and seven constables have already been suspended besides the Assistant Secretary, Transport Authority of Delhi government.

Lieutenant Governor Tejinder Khanna has also suspended two ACP rank officers immediately after the gang-rape incident.

Thus, 11 officers of various ranks have been suspended and proceedings against seven senior officers have started, sources said.

The 23-year-old girl was gang-raped on a moving bus by six men on December 16 leading to huge public outrage. The girl died in a Singapore hospital on December 19.

New Delhi:
Reports of rape in Delhi have more than doubled between January and March this year as compared with the same period last year, according to the Delhi Police.

Police say their records show that the number of molestation cases reported has increased more than six-fold, and that the rise in numbers is due to increased instances of complaints being registered.

There were 115 cases of molestation and 143 cases of rape reported for the period between January and March last year; this year those figures are 794 and 359 respectively.

Other crimes such as kidnapping and burglary have also spiked in the capital. Police say they have registered 1040 cases of kidnapping so far this year and 453 cases of burglary.
According to National Crime Records Bureau data, the number of rape cases reported in Delhi in 2012 - 706 - was the highest in the last 10 years.

Delhi's notoriety as an unsafe city for women was brutally underscored when a 23-year-old medical student was brutally assaulted and gang-raped on December 16 last year.

The government and police have been under immense pressure since then to step up safety measures for women in Delhi.

The Delhi government has announced a slew of measures to that end since December.

It said that it would double the number of Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses that ply along the capital's routes at night and deploy home guards on buses at night.
The government has also set up a special 24X7 helpline service for women in the capital.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Police has said it will press 350 new patrol vans to beef up security. Twelve of them, equipped with GPS and long-range weapons, rolled out in January this year.

New Delhi:
Delhi Police today opposed the plea of two of the four accused in the December 16 gang-rape case for use of Hindi language during the trial proceedings as they do not understand English, calling it a ""delaying tactic"".

""The applications have been filed after 63 witnesses have been examined, so it is purely a delaying tactic on the part of the accused and nothing more,"" Special Public Prosecutor Dayan Krishnan told a Special Court while responding to the plea of Mukesh and Akshay Singh.

Krishnan termed as ""false"" the plea of defence lawyer M L Sharma that previous counsel V K Anand did not discuss facts and evidence with the accused.

""Accused Mukseh and Akshay be provided Hindi translation of testimonies of prosecution witnesses. I would not examine the witnesses,"" defence lawyer Sharma said, adding that they were being denied a fair trial.

Meanwhile, another accused sought a direction from the court that he be provided tuition inside Tihar jail as he has to appear in a test on April 7 for recruitment of clerks in the IAF.

Vinay Sharma, in his application plea before Additional Sessions Judge Yogesh Khanna, said he has to appear for written and other tests to be held for the recruitment of group 'C' civilian lower divisional clerks (LDCs) in the Indian Air Force.

The accused, in the plea filed through lawyer A P Singh, said he be provided ""proper tuitions and books"" for helping him to prepare for the tests.

A defendant in the New Delhi bus gang-rape trial was admitted to hospital on Monday with chest pains, a fortnight after his brother and co-accused was found dead in a prison cell, a report said.

Mukesh Singh was taken to Safdarjung hospital after he complained of feeling unwell while in transit from Tihar jail to the court, the Press Trust of India news agency quoted public prosecutor Dayan Krishnan as telling the trial judge.

Proceedings at the court in Saket, in south Delhi, were adjourned in the afternoon as officials waited for the hospital report.

Mukesh Singh is one of four men on trial for the murder and gang-rape of a 23-year-old student who died in hospital in Singapore on December 29, 13 days after being attacked on a bus as she returned from a movie in Delhi.

A 17-year-old defendant is being tried separately in a youth court.

Mukesh Singh's brother, Ram Singh, who was the driver of the bus used in the attack, was found hanging in his prison cell in Tihar on March 11.

Women have become increasingly worried about their safety in New Delhi after the gang rape and torture of a young woman aboard a moving bus last December. Not for nothing do people call the city India's rape capital. Beyond the leers and the crass words that men often direct at women walking on the street, fresh fears have arisen over stalkers.

The Lok Sabha passed a bill to toughen penalties on rape and sexual assault on Tuesday, and among its penalties, it would make stalking punishable by jail time. But first-time offenders will be able to avoid being detained till investigation is complete, as the offence is bailable.

That, of course, disappointed many people. ""1st time stalkers get bail, so they get out and harass, and maybe attack the woman they were stalking?"" journalist Padmaja Joshi wrote on Twitter. @Neilima wrote, ""1st time stalker getting bail will probably lead on a second attack. Only, it'll be a lot worse than just stalking her.""

But what happens if someone falsely accuses someone of stalking? If the offence is non-bailable, police have the right to arrest or detain the accused stalker before they begin investigating the case, said Vijay Kumar, a lawyer who argues cases before the Supreme Court.

Karuna Nundy, another Supreme Court lawyer, had a different view. ""I find concerns of 'misuse' come up most often when a law isn't deeply felt to be legitimate in the first place...""

In at least one case, India revisited a law designed to protect women over concerns that it could be misused. The Supreme Court in 2010 directed the government to re-examine a law against dowries, saying that some women used it to lodge false complaints accusing their husbands and relatives of cruel behaviour.

A government panel in October 2012 said India should tone down the law to prevent the immediate arrest of family members against whom police complaints are filed by their wives.

Men with no thought of stalking on their minds shouldn't worry, I would imagine. Or maybe they should? The definition of the crime in the bill in question says:

Any man who-

follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such woman to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such woman; or monitors the use by a woman of the internet, email or any other form of electronic communication; or watches or spies on a woman in any manner, that results in a fear of violence or serious alarm or distress in the mind of such woman, or interferes with the mental peace of the woman, commits the offence of stalking.

That last clause caught my attention. I remember that, a few weeks after the gang rape, while going home after work, I was walking behind a woman who was going to the same apartment complex as mine. Though she was talking on the phone, she turned and stared at me four times. I quickly walked past her, thinking all the while, ""Does she think I am stalking her? What if she called the police on me?""

Fifty-one per cent of women polled in a survey conducted by Hindustan Times in March 2011 said they have been stalked. This is clearly a problem, never mind the anecdotes you will hear if you ask enough women about whether it has happened to them.

The question now is whether allowing bail for first-time offenders is an unforgivable lapse or whether it's necessary to provide some relief to people who are falsely accused.

A provision of bail for first-time offenders might be better to have on hand from the beginning rather than something to be regretted later.

Kiran Bedi, former police officer and anti-corruption activist, agrees that this gives breathing space to those falsely implicated.

""I think they've followed the middle path,"" she said, explaining the provision is neither victim- nor accused-centric. ""Bailable is striking the balance ... now the onus goes on individual prosecutors and individual judges.""

In this photograph taken on May 2, 2010, Foreign tourists walk past a stall in the backpackers tourist area of New Delhi.
New Delhi:
Danish tourist Judith Jensen has a long list of don'ts to help her feel safe during her holiday in India.

She won't hail a taxi off the street, she won't stay in an obscure hotel and she won't go out after dark - all decisions made in response to the growing reporting of sexual crime in the country.

""I have read and heard so much about rape in India that now I feel this persistent sense of danger,"" Jensen, 42, told AFP as she walked through a popular market in downtown Delhi.

The tourism ministry's ubiquitous Incredible India marketing campaign has helped raise the number of foreign visitors over the past decade to around 6.6 million a year - albeit still way behind the likes of China and Malaysia.

But that push is now hampered by a growing sense that India is simply not a safe destination, particularly for women.

The fatal gang-rape of an Indian student in December shone a disturbing light on the level of sexual violence and a series of subsequent attacks on foreigners has added to the sense of unease.

A British holidaymaker in the northern city of Agra, home to the Taj Mahal, suffered a leg injury when she jumped out of a hotel window before dawn on Tuesday.

Police said she feared a sex attack after two men tried to enter her room.

Last Friday a Swiss woman was gang-raped while on a cycling holiday in central India. Her husband was tied up by the gang who are also accused of stealing a laptop, a mobile phone and 10,000 rupees ($185).

On the same night a group of men in a city near Delhi briefly kidnapped an Indian male executive working for the French engineering giant Alstom.

Other incidents reported since the December gang-rape include that of a South Korean student who said she had been raped and drugged by the son of the owner of the hotel where she stayed during a holiday in January.

A Chinese woman working in Gurgaon, a town bordering the Indian capital, was also reportedly raped by an acquaintance last month.

Indian officials say there is no need for alarm, pointing out that foreigners are victims of crime the world over and the vast majority of visitors experience no safety problems.

But travel advice from a host of countries stresses the need for visitors to take care.

An advisory from the Swiss foreign ministry, issued before Friday's attack, urged men and women visiting India to travel in large groups and with guides.

The US State Department's website asks female travellers to ""observe stringent security precautions"" and ""avoid travelling alone in hired taxis, especially at night"".

Britain's foreign office updated its advisory for India on Tuesday, warning female tourists to ""exercise caution when travelling in India even if they are travelling in a group"".

In a notorious case five years ago, 15-year-old British schoolgirl Scarlett Keeling was raped and left to die on a beach in the tourist resort of Goa.

Jensen, who stands out in an Indian crowd with her blonde hair, recalled how she spent a carefree week backpacking around southern India a decade ago.

But now, travelling with her 10-year-old daughter, it is a different story and her husband texts her several times a day to check on their safety.

""There is no question that these stories will have an impact on foreign visitors,"" she said.

""Women will prefer to visit other places like Singapore or Bali or Thailand, where safety is not such a big concern.""

At the Delhi office of the Indian Association of Tour Operators, executive director Gour Kanjilal said it was unfair to portray India as dangerous.

""Our industry is the first casualty when crime against foreigners is reported in India, but the reporting does not always reflect the truth,"" he told AFP.

""Tourists should be responsible. They should follow some do's and don'ts.""

A state minister in Madhya Pradesh, where the attacks on the Swiss and South Korean tourists took place, told reporters on Sunday that travellers must inform local police officials whenever they move from one town to the next.

That suggestion is hardly realistic for most tourists like 26-year-old Peruvian Marilu Labarthe, who squeezed in visits to seven cities during a two-week trip to the country.

Labarthe, shopping for ethnic trinkets in Delhi on the last day of her vacation, travelled to the country with 11 other women.

""You have to always be careful. And after hearing of these recent incidents, one obviously feels a sense of fear,"" she said, as one of her companions nodded in agreement.

New Delhi:
Crime against women in trains has been on a rise despite deployment of security personnel by Railways, with more than 200 cases including rape, molestation and misbehaviour reported last year.

There were total 210 cases of crime against women registered in 2012 as against 127 cases in 2011. The number of crimes committed against women in trains was 85 in 2010, according to Railway Ministry data.

While molestation cases in trains have gone up from 52 in 2010 to 72 in 2011, the number touched 119 in 2012. Rape cases have also increased from 3 in 2011 to 7 in 2012.

Cases of misbehaviour with women were also reported in trains. The number of such cases increased from 33 in 2010 to 52 in 2011. 2012 witnessed 84 cases of misbehaviour in trains.

Maximum molestation cases (45) were reported in Southern Railway followed by 19 cases in Western Central Railway in 2012.

Southern Railway also leads in the number of misbehaviour cases in comparison to other zones. There were 33 misbehaviour cases reported in 2012 followed by 18 cases in South Central Railway.

As per the data, while 120 people were arrested for crimes against women in 2010, the number went up to 146 in 2011 and 170 in 2012.

Railways have taken several steps to ensure security of women passengers, a senior Railway Ministry official said.

Currently, 1,275 trains are being escorted by Railway Protection Force (RPF) daily on an average in addition to 2,220 trains escorted by Government Railway Police (GRP).

Ladies special trains are being escorted by lady RPF staff, wherever available in suburban sections also.

Security helpline numbers have been set up in the zonal control rooms over some zonal railways to facilitate the passengers to inform about any untoward incident, the official said.

The numbers of such security helplines have been displayed at prominent places of stations and in the coaches.

Regular drives are also conducted to prevent entry of male passengers in ladies compartments and if found, they are prosecuted under the provisions of the Railways Act, he said.

FIle photo of people protesting the brutal gang-rape of medical student
New Delhi:
Delhi police filed a charge sheet against the accused in the December 16 gang-rape case in a separate case of robbery lodged against them for looting a vegetable seller before brutally assaulting the medical student.

During a closed-door proceeding, the police filed its charge sheet against all the accused before Metropolitan Magistrate Akash Jain, who also took cognisance of the final report, court sources said.
""Cognisance taken. To come for scrutiny of documents and consideration on March 3,"" the magistrate said.

According to sources, the charge sheet was filed for the offences punishable under various sections, including 395 (dacoity) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the India Penal Code (IPC).

The six accused, bus driver Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta, Akshay Singh and a juvenile, had allegedly robbed Ramadhar Singh, a vegetable seller, of his day's earnings after luring him into the bus.

According to sources, the proceedings against Ram Singh would be abated as he had allegedly committed suicide inside the Tihar Jail.

The juvenile, who was acting as the conductor, has been named in this case but a separate charge sheet has already been filed against him before the Juvenile Justice Board.

The other four adult accused are also facing trial in the gang-rape case before a fast-track court and they have pleaded not guilty to the charges framed against them.

According to the police, Ramadhar, a resident of Sangam Vihar in South Delhi, was returning home from the RK Puram market when he was lured into the bus and robbed by the accused, who took away Rs 700 and a mobile phone from him.

Police had later on recovered the amount and the mobile phone from the accused.

The tracking of this incident helped the cops in establishing the movement of all the six accused on that fateful day.

They had allegedly pushed Ramadhar out of the bus near the IIT flyover on the evening of December 16 and then moved towards Munirka bus stand where the student and her male friend were waiting for public transport, it had said.

New Delhi:
Two months ago, the Delhi Police allegedly intercepted calls from a Tihar Jail inmate, who was illegally using the phone of a jail employee. In one conversation the inmate, say sources, hinted that there could be an attack on the five men accused of brutally gang-raping a medical student on a bus in Delhi. One of them, Ram Singh, was found hanging in his Tihar Jail cell on Monday morning.

Sources said that in the conversation allegedly intercepted by the police, the inmate indicated that the rape accused could be attacked while on their way to the Saket fast track court for daily hearings. Tihar jail officials were reportedly briefed about this specific threat and security for the five men was increased. Lately, about 20 to 30 gun-toting policemen would escort them to the court and inside it.

The Tihar Jail authorities are yet to submit a preliminary report on Ram Singh's death, the circumstances of which have raised many questions. He was found hanging at 5 am in a cell he shared with three other prisoners. They apparently slept through his alleged suicide, which was also not detected by a guard posted to monitor the cell. An autopsy report said yesterday that he died from hanging and that there was no external injury on Ram Singh's body.

But his family insists that he was murdered and have sought a CBI inquiry.

Ram Singh and the other accused had earlier pleaded in court that they feared for their lives at Tihar, where other convicts often taunted and even assaulted them. Police sources have emphasised that this specific threat was about an attack outside the jail premises. But, they suggest, it was implicit that security all around must be tightened.

After Ram Singh's death, Tihar Jail has arranged for round-the clock CCTV surveillance of the cells that the other four men accused in the case are lodged in. Their lawyers had written to Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Delhi's Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar requesting that they either be shifted to another jail or then be provided extra security at Tihar.

In court on Monday, the day Ram Singh died, the lawyers said their clients told the judge, ""Shoot us, but don't send us back to Tihar Jail.""  Their request was turned down, but the judge has asked jail officials to submit a daily report on the security arrangements for the suspects.

On the night of December 16, six men brutally raped the 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus.  The woman died in hospital two weeks later. Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh and four other men were arrested soon after the attack. All six suspects pleaded not guilty to rape and murder charges. One of them, who is 17, is being tried by a juvenile court.

New Delhi:
After Ram Singh, one of the men accused of brutally gang-raping a medical student in Delhi was found hanging in his Tihar Jail cell yesterday, four other men facing trial in the case and lodged at Tihar have written to the Home Minister and Delhi's police chief asking for more security.

The lawyers of the four men have written a letter to Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and Delhi's Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar requesting that they either be shifted to another jail or then be provided extra security at Tihar.  

A copy of the letter has also been sent to the Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court.

In court yesterday,the lawyers said, their clients told the judge, ""Shoot us, but don't send us back to Tihar Jail.""  Their request was turned down, but the judge has asked jail officials to submit a daily report on the security arrangements for the suspects.

Ram Singh, 35, was discovered dead at 5 am in a cell he shared with three other prisoners, none of them linked to the Delhi gang-rape case. They apparently slept through his alleged suicide, which was also not detected by a guard posted to monitor the cell round-the-clock because Mr Singh was on ""a suicide watch.""

His family says he was murdered. They have also said they fear for the life of his younger brother, Mukesh, who is also one of the men accused in the case.

The police say that on the night of December 16, the six suspects, led by Mr Singh, headed out on the school bus he used to drive by day.

They allegedly picked up a 23-year-old physiotherapy trainee and her male friend, assaulted them both with an iron rod, took turns raping the student, then threw the couple onto the road. The woman died in hospital two weeks later. The barbarous attack on her triggered huge protests and a call for urgent, new anti-rape laws, introduced by the government last month.

All six suspects have pleaded not guilty to rape and murder charges. One of them, who is 17, is being tried by a juvenile court.

New Delhi:
Delhi Police on Tuesday gave a clean chit to eight people booked in constable Subhash Tomar's death during the anti-rape protests in New Delhi in December last year.

Appearing for the police, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sidharth Luthra told the court that no evidence was found to link the eight accused to the constable's death.

However, Mr Luthra said that they were involved in destruction of public property near India Gate during the protests against the gang-rape of a 23-year-old woman.

""We have electronic records (phone locations records). They were involved in damaging public property but they were not involved in Tomar's death,"" Mr Luthra added.

The court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Somnath Bharti on behalf of the eight accused booked for the constable's death case for quashing charges against them.

Justice G.P. Mittal posted the matter for final arguments for March 20.

Police had earlier said that Mr Tomar was assaulted and trampled upon by the crowd at India Gate. However, two witnesses said that he collapsed while chasing the crowd and that he was not beaten or trampled by the protestors.

The trial court granted bail to the accused on December 24. They had been arrested on charges of murder.

Justice Mittal will also hear another petition filed by lawyer Gaurav Kumar Bansal seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into Mr Tomar's death while controlling anti-rape protests near India Gate in December 2012.

Mr Tomar died two days after he collapsed on the road. Mr Bansal alleged that there were contradictions in the versions of police, witnesses and doctors.

The plea said the police commissioner's statement was contradictory to the version of two witnesses - Yogendra and Pauline - and the medical superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, where Mr Tomar was admitted and later died.

New Delhi:
Doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) have completed the autopsy of Delhi gang-rape accused Ram Singh who was found dead in his cell in Tihar Jail yesterday. Sources say the initial findings of the post-mortem suggest suicide. Police had found Ram Singh hanging in his cell in Jail No 3 Monday morning, and say that he killed himself.

Ram Singh's parents and the Metropolitan Magistrate investigating the case were present throughout the two-hour procedure conducted by a team of three doctors, which included the head of the forensic department. An official copy of the autopsy report will be handed over to the magistrate.

Meanwhile, Tihar Jail authorities have sent a report detailing the security arrangements that were in place for Ram Singh to the fast-track court that is trying the gang-rape case. The report will be examined by the court later today.

Ram Singh, accused of leading a gang of six that allegedly battered and fatally raped a medical student on a bus in Delhi last December, was killed, allege his parents and lawyer. They want the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to determine how he died.

Jail authorities claim that the 35-year-old committed suicide by using his shirt and threads from his sleeping mat to construct a rope, which he then hung from a grille on the 10-foot-high ceiling by using a plastic bucket. But they are unable to explain how three cell-mates slept through the hanging in a tiny 12 by 12 feet room.

They also do not have answers for why or how a guard, posted round-the-clock near the cell because Ram Singh was thought to be suicidal, missed what happened. Though there are security cameras in this section of Tihar, none were positioned to film Ram Singh's cell.

Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, to whom the Tihar Jail chief reports, said ""Whatever happened was wrong. When the inquiry report comes up, appropriate action will be taken.""

Yesterday, the four other men accused in the gang-rape and lodged in Tihar pleaded in court that they be shifted from there as they felt unsafe. The sixth suspect is a juvenile and is being tried and kept separately. 

The heinous assault on the 23-year-old medical student triggered street protests, tough new anti-rape laws and a national debate about the lack of security for women across India.

The main suspect in the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a Delhi bus, an attack that triggered angry protests and new laws to punish crimes against women, was discovered hanging in his prison cell by a constable at 5 am, jail officials told NDTV. (Read)

They claimed that three other men, who shared Ram Singh's cell at Tihar Jail, were asleep when he killed himself, using his shirt, and parts of a sleeping mat to suspend himself.  

They denied reports that a wooden stool was found in the cell, and said they are not clear on how he managed to attach the rope he created to the grill of a ceiling that was at least eight feet high, or how other prisoners in the tiny cell, 10 feet long and wide, were not wakened.

Ram Singh's family and lawyers have rejected this explanation, and want a CBI inquiry to determine how he died. His lawyer VK Anand said his client's death should be treated as murder.

Ram Singh's parents, who are from Rajasthan, say they met with him recently and he complained that he was being tortured in prison. ""He made a mistake -- he admitted that to us -- but even God forgives one mistake,"" said his mother to news agency AFP. ""He was not even given a chance to repent.""

He was being tried at a fast-track court for murder and rape along with four other men, including his brother Mukesh. They have pleaded not guilty. The sixth suspect is being tried separately because he is a juvenile.

Ram Singh's family says they are worried about Mukesh's safety now.

When the men were arrested, their lawyers argued that the trial should be moved away from Delhi because overwhelming public sentiment would deprive their clients of a fair trial. The defence lawyers had also warned that the suspects were vulnerable to attacks from other prisoners in jail.

""I wanted him to be hanged ... publicly. Him dying on his own terms seems unfair,"" said the brother of the student who died. (Read)

Ram Singh, the man described by the Delhi Police as the mastermind of the fatal gang-rape of a medical student in Delhi, an attack that stunned India and stirred angry protests, was found dead in his cell at Tihar Jail this morning. Officials say he committed suicide, but are unable to explain vital details.
Here are 10 latest developments in the case:
Hours after Ram Singh's alleged suicide, the four other men accused of the student's murder and gang-rape were brought to a fast-track court, which is handling their trial. They asked to be moved from Tihar Jail. Shoot us, but don't send us back there, they said in court.
For the first time since their arrest in December, the men were seen in public without woollen scarves or hats covering their faces to protect their identity.
Ram Singh, who was 35, was discovered hanging in his cell by a constable at  5 am. Tihar Jail officials were not able to explain how his three cell-mates slept through the alleged suicide in the tiny room. (Read)

Of the six men accused of the student's gang-rape and murder, five - including Ram Singh and his brother Mukesh - are on trial at a fast-track court in South Delhi. The sixth is a juvenile and is being tried separately.
The five men at Tihar were at risk from other prisoners, their lawyers had argued in court. They said other inmates were aware of reports of the savagery of the way in which the student was attacked, and regularly threatened and tried to assault the suspects.
The family of the student who died has said that it wanted all six suspects hanged if they are convicted. Reacting to the news of Ram Singh's suicide, her brother said, ""He knew he was going to die anyway because we had and still have such a strong case against him. I'm not very thrilled with the news that he killed himself because I wanted him to be hanged publicly. Him dying on his own terms seems unfair."" (Read)
On December 16 last year, a 23-year-old physiotherapy trainee was gang-raped on a Delhi bus. Prosecutors have alleged that it was Ram Singh's idea to take the school bus he drove by day out for ""a joyride"" with his friends at night. The men first robbed a male passenger. Ram Singh's brother Mukesh was allegedly driving when the gang saw Amanat (NOT her real name) and her male friend waiting for a bus in South Delhi.
 After the couple boarded the bus, they were hit with an iron rod and then Amanat was raped before the couple was thrown onto the road. She died two weeks later of severe injuries from her brutal attack.

New Delhi:
The main suspect in the fatal gang rape of a medical student on a Delhi bus, an attack that triggered angry  protests and new laws to punish crimes against women, allegedly committed suicide in jail early this morning. (Read)

""He tied all his clothes together and used the ceiling grill and a wooden stool to hang himself,"" said Sunil Gupta, an official from Tihar Jail.

Ram Singh's family and lawyers disagree, and want a CBI inquiry to determine how he died.

Jail officials said Ram Singh, 35, shared his cell with two other prisoners, and a security guard was meant to be posted outside because he had been reported suicidal.

There are no details yet on how the suicide went unnoticed by anyone.

Delhi Police sources say they discovered Ram Singh's death through television reports. Tihar Jail officials did not inform them of the suicide for nearly three hours. Jail sources say he was rushed to hospital to see if he could be revived by doctors. (Read: Discovered Ram Singh's suicide through TV channels, says Delhi Police)

New Delhi:
In a huge security lapse, Ram Singh, one of the six men accused of brutally gang-raping a medical student in a moving bus in Delhi last December, has allegedly committed suicide at Tihar Jail, where he was lodged. His body was found at around 5 this morning in Jail Number 3. 

Delhi Police sources say they discovered Ram Singh's death through television reports. Tihar Jail officials did not inform them of the suicide for nearly three hours. Jail sources say he was rushed to hospital to see if he could be revived by doctors. (Read: 10 developments in the case)

Prison officials said Ram Singh used a wooden stool to hang himself with his own clothes from a ceiling grille. A magisterial inquiry has been ordered into how the 35-year-old managed to kill himself despite being under a ""suicide watch"" that meant additional security round the clock.

Latest reports say he was not lodged in isolation, but in a secure 12 feet by 12 feet cell with three to four other inmates, and a guard posted outside at all times. Yet, a senior official told PTI, ""nobody came to know about it.""

Ram Singh's lawyer and family allege that he has been killed. His lawyer, AP Singh, said, ""It is not a suicide case. It is a conspiracy and murder."" His family has sought a Central Bureau of Investigation or CBI inquiry. (Read)

The body of the accused is still at Tihar Jail and the magistrate will decide which hospital it will be sent to for an autopsy.  Right now, the Crime Branch and a forensic team are at Tihar and other convicts are being questioned. The home ministry has sought a detailed report. Delhi's Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit  met  Home Minster  Sushil Kumar Shinde. She refused to comment on the incident till the magisterial inquiry submitted its findings.  

The fast-track court trying Ram Singh and four other adults accused in the case had rejected a petition to shift their trial out of Delhi, but they had been given extra security after their lawyers pleaded that they were at risk from other prisoners in jail. They were also escorted to the Saket court across town for hearings by about 20 to 30 gun-wielding policemen. The lawyers had argued that other inmates were aware of reports of the savagery of the way in which the student was attacked, and regularly threatened and tried to assault the suspects.

Ram Singh, described as a man prone to violence and mood swings, (read) was the driver of the bus in which six men inflicted a horrific assault on 23-year-old student Amanat (Not her real name) on December 16 last year. She died in a Singapore hospital 13 days later. Like Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh and three other men were charged with rape, assault and murder and are being tried by the fast-track court.  The sixth accused is a minor and is being tried separately by the Juvenile Justice Board.

The main suspect in the fatal gang-rape of a medical student onboard a New Delhi bus, an attack that horrified the country and triggered protests and new laws to punish crimes against women, allegedly committed suicide in jail early this morning.

""He tied all his clothes together and used the ceiling grill and a wooden stool to hang himself,"" said Sunil Gupta, an official from Tihar Jail.  

Jail officials said Ram Singh, 35, shared his cell with two other prisoners, and a security guard was meant to be posted outside because he had been reported suicidal.
There are no details yet on how the suicide went unnoticed by anyone.

""It is not a suicide, it is a murder. It is a murder with a criminal conspiracy by some ulterior motive and I demand that a CBI inquiry must be conducted in this case as soon as possible,"" said defence lawyer AP Singh.

Ram Singh's family wants a CBI inquiry to determine how he died. ""He couldn't have committed suicide with just one hand,"" Ram Singh's father said. His parents, who are from Rajasthan, say they met with him recently and he complained that he was beaten up when he was first brought to prison, and mistreated by other inmates.

""He knew he was going to die anyway because we had and still have such a strong case against him,"" said the brother of the student who was sexually assaulted and battered with an iron rod on the bus.

Ram Singh was being tried at a fast-track court for murder and rape along with four other men, including his brother Mukesh. They have pleaded not guilty. If convicted, the men could face the death penalty. The sixth accused is being tried and jailed separately because he is a juvenile.

Ram Singh's family says police officials did not allow them to visit him in jail, so they spoke to him at court. They are worried about Mukesh's safety now.

""He made a mistake - he admitted that to us - but even God forgives one mistake,"" said Ram Singh's mother.

When the men were arrested, their lawyers argued that the trial should be moved away from Delhi because overwhelming public sentiment would deprive their clients of a fair trial.  The defence lawyers had also warned that the suspects were vulnerable to attacks from other prisoners in jail.

The main suspect in the gang rape and fatal beating of a woman on a New Delhi bus, an attack that horrified Indians and set off national protests, committed suicide in jail on Monday, police officials said. (Read: 10 developments in the case)

Ram Singh, who is accused of driving the bus on which the 23-year-old student was raped and fatally assaulted by a group of six men in December, hanged himself with his own clothes, said G. Sudhakar, the top police official at Tihar jail. (Main accused Ram Singh allegedly commits suicide in Tihar Jail)

Singh, along with four other men on trial with him on rape, murder and abduction charges, had been under a suicide watch, another jail official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. He said the five were being held in separate cells in separate buildings at the jail. (Read: accused were on suicide watch since January, officials claimed)

If convicted, the men could face the death penalty. The sixth accused is being tried and jailed separately because he is a juvenile.

Singh's lawyer, A. P. Singh, confirmed his client's death, saying he died at 5:30 a.m. He alleged that police maleficence led to his client's death.

""What do you mean killed himself? He has been killed in prison,"" Singh said.

Lawyers for the men have previously accused police of beating confessions out of their clients.

Indian jails have a reputation for overcrowding, poor management and brutal treatment of inmates.

The woman and a male friend were attacked after boarding the bus Dec. 16 as they tried to return home after watching a movie, police say. The six men, the only occupants of the private bus, beat the man with a metal bar, raped the woman and used the bar to inflict massive internal injuries to her, police say. The victims were dumped naked on the roadside, and the woman died from her injuries two weeks later in a Singapore hospital.

The brutal attack set off nationwide protests about India's treatment of women and spurred the government to hurry through a new package of laws to protect them.

Singh's death comes as the trial was deep underway, with another hearing scheduled for Monday. There was no word if that would be affected.

New Delhi:
Ram Singh was the driver of the white, private bus - used as a school bus on weekdays - in which six men brutally gang-raped a 23-year-old medical student on the evening of Sunday, December 16, 2012. He was one of the six men accused in the case. Early on March 11, he allegedly hanged himself with his own clothes at Delhi's high-security Tihar Jail. (Read)

The 35-year-old driver faced the same multiple charges, including murder, that the other four adults accused in the case do. But he was largely seen as the ring-leader. For one, he was the oldest in the group. According the police, he was also the one who suggested taking the bus out on an unscheduled run on the evening that the student was gang-raped and brutally battered before being flung out of the bus along with her male friend. Amanat (Not her real name) died in a Singapore hospital 13 days after the horrific assault. (Read: 10 developments in the case)

Ram Singh was from Rajasthan, one of the many young men from the heartland who come to the capital in search of a livelihood. He lived in the Ravidas camp, an urban slum in the middle of south Delhi's RK Puram, which largely houses government quarters.

Police investigation revealed a history of bad temper, quarrels and run-ins with employers. His neighbours described a man often seen drunk after work. And when drunk, they said, he would to prone to blinding rage.

His friends called Ram Singh ""Mental"" alluding perhaps abnormal behaviour at times. Others around him said they were afraid of him. Of his four brothers, three had left the family home reportedly because he ill-treated them. In December, when he was arrested, Ram Singh was living in a one-room tenement with his younger brother, Mukesh, who is also one of the six men accused in the case.

In 2009, Ram Singh had a serious accident while driving a bus and an iron rod had to be inserted in one of his arms. The police say that the injury made Ram Singh even more bitter and violent. His wife's death three years ago of kidney failure had added to the rage, they said.

New Delhi:
Early in January, just days after the medical student they were accused of raping died in a Singapore hospital, the five men in Tihar Jail accused of raping and murdering her appeared to be depressed and were on ""suicide watch,"" jail officials had said.

A sixth suspect, who was underage, had been kept at a juvenile home and was being tried separately.

Early this morning, Ram Singh, 35, the main accused, hanged himself in his cell.

In January, Authorities at Tihar Jail said the five men there ""just sit and brood.""

A senior officer had been told to monitor their activities.

""We are putting all kinds of check on them to keep them away from (committing) any untoward incident. They are basically on suicide watch,"" a jail official had told news agency IANS, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Ram Singh was known to be prone to violence, jail officials said.

Before he was arrested, he lived in South Delhi with his brother, Mukesh. On the night of December 16, he allegedly decided to take the school bus he drove everyday  for a spin with his friends. The police says Mukesh was driving the bus when the six men on board saw a young girl and a man waiting at a bus stop.

The couple thought the bus was the sort of privately-owned vehicle used by thousands  of commuters in Delhi everyday.  After they climbed on board, the men allegedly battered them with an iron rod, before taking turns to rape Amanat (Not her real name).

When they were thrown onto the road an hour later, the police says Ram Singh urged tellers to run over Amanat, but her friend managed to push her of of the way.

The attack stirred grief and anger, with thousands holding street protests in different cities to demand a speedy trial for the accused, and better safety ad public transport for women.

There was outrage in India, with protesters demanding the death penalty for the accused and changes in rape laws.

The trial for Ram Singh and the other adults was held in-camera or behind closed doors.  40 of nearly 80 witnesses for the prosecution ave testified so far, including the software engineer who was with Amanat on the bus.

New Delhi:
In a huge security lapse, Ram Singh, one of the men accused in the gang-rape of a medical student in a moving bus in Delhi last December, has allegedly committed suicide at Tihar Jail, where he was lodged. His body was found in Jail Number 3 at around 5 this morning. (Read: 10 developments in the case)

News agency AFP quoted prison's law officer Sunil Gupta as saying, ""He tied all his clothes together and used the ceiling grille and a wooden stool to hang himself.""

A magisterial inquiry has been ordered into how Ram Singh managed to kill himself despite being under a ""suicide watch"" that meant additional security round the clock. There are conflicting reports on whether he was lodged in an isolation cell or one with other inmates in it. Press Trust of India quoted a senior jail official as saying, ""Singh was not alone in the cell. Other inmates were present and a guard was also posted. But nobody came to know about it. At around 5 am, he was found hanging.""

Ram Singh's lawyer, AP Singh, told the Associated Press, ""What do you mean killed himself? He has been killed in prison."" His family too has said that they believe Ram Singh was killed. (Read: accused were on suicide watch since January, officials claimed)

The Crime Branch and a forensic team are at Tihar investigating his death. Other convicts are being questioned inside the prison. The Home Ministry has sought a report.

Ram Singh, 35, was the driver of the bus in which six men inflicted a horrific assault on 23-year-old student Amanat (Not her real name) on December 16 last year. His brother Mukesh and three other men are also being tried by a fast-track court and are lodged at Tihar. The sixth accused is a minor and is being tried separately by the Juvenile Justice Board.

The court had rejected a petition filed by the accused to shift their trial out of Delhi, but the five men had been given extra security after their lawyers pleaded that they were at risk from other prisoners in Tihar. They were escorted to the Saket court across town for hearings by about 20 to 30 gun-wielding policemen. The lawyers of the accused had argued that other inmates were aware of reports of the savagery of the way in which the student was attacked, and regularly threatened and tried to assault the suspects.

Officials said Ram Singh, prone to violent behaviour and mood swings, had not seemed inordinately quiet or in any way different than usual in the past few days. During court hearings, he would interact with the other accused as he always did, they said. (Read: Ram Singh was prone to mood swings, violent outbursts, say officials)

It is not clear yet whether and how his suicide will impact the trial of the five other suspects.

The 20-year-old brother of Amanat told Reuters, ""He (Ram Singh) knew he was going to die anyway because we had and still have such a strong case against him...I'm not very thrilled with the news that he killed himself because I wanted him to be hanged... publicly. Him dying on his own terms seems unfair.""

All five men faced multiple charges, including murder, for gang-raping the young woman in the bus and then throwing her out on the road with mortal wounds. She fought a valiant battle for her life in hospital for 13 days, but her injuries were too severe and she died in a Singapore hospital on December 29. All the accused were arrested within days of the incident.

The gang-rape sparked outrage in the country and people took to the streets to demand the most stringent punishment for the accused. It also led the government to draft new and more stringent anti-rape laws.

New Delhi:
Scores of teachers from primary schools of three municipal corporations today staged a demonstration here to protest suspension of five of their staff members in the wake of the rape of a seven-year-old in a school in Mongolpuri on March 1.

""We demand that the suspended staff be reinstated immediately and that a departmental enquiry be constituted in the matter,"" said Chairman of the Joint Council of Primary Teachers Ram Kishan Punia, adding that the council condemned the incident in strongest terms.

Four staff members of the Mongolpuri school - Principal Neelam Karwal, class teacher Monica Kohli, school attendant Sushila and watchman Kailash - were suspended on March 2 by NDMC Commissioner PK Gupta. School Inspector Balraj Singh was also suspended.

Refuting the charge that the alleged rape took place inside the school premises, suspended principal of the school in question denied involvement of any staff members in the crime.

""The child was all right in the afternoon when she went home. The rape didn't happen in our school and the staff is innocent,"" claimed Neelam Karwal at the demonstration in Jantar Mantar.

""If the incident happened in the premises, why wasn't a complaint lodged on the same day. In fact, when the parents came to school the next day, they didn't talk to us but started protesting,"" she said.

Kohli also supported the principal. ""We were there the whole time and the incident could not have happened inside the building. I hope you all will support us,"" Kohli said.

Demanding that responsibility be fixed at the highest level, spokesperson of the Council Sajid Usmani demanded a fair enquiry.

""Even today, no one knows exactly where the incident happened. Why is no one asking for the resignation of the education director or the commissioner? We demand that a departmental enquiry be conducted and only then action taken against those found guilty,"" Usmani said.

More than a week after the alleged rape, police have been unable to name a suspect in the case.

New Delhi:
The 23-year-old medical student whose brutal gang-rape on a moving bus in Delhi in December last year inspired widespread protests across India has been posthumously presented with the International Women of Courage Award by the US.

""Her bravery inspired millions of women and men to come together with a simple message: No more. No more looking the other way when gender-based violence happens. No more stigma against victims or survivors,"" US Secretary of State, John Kerry, said at a State Department function held yesterday to
honour women from across the globe with the prestigious award.

As none of the family members of Amanat (NOT her real name) were present to accept the award, it was presented to the Indian Ambassador to the US, Nirupama Rao. Eight others were also honoured.

As he presented the award, the US Secretary of State asked the jam-packed auditorium to join him in observing a moment of silence for Amanat, whom he described as ""brave and fearless"".

""Her fight survives her. For inspiring people to work together to end violence against women in India and around the world by displaying immense courage in demanding justice, and with great sadness, we honour her as a woman of exceptional courage, ""he said.  The function was presided over by the US First Lady, Michelle Obama.

On December 16, Amanat had left a South Delhi mall with a male friend and boarded a bus to return home.  A gang of six men on the bus hit the couple with an iron rod, raped Amanat, and then threw her friend and her, naked and bleeding, onto the road. She died two weeks later.  

The case triggered wide-spread protests across India with protesters demanding tough new laws to punish crimes against women.

New Delhi:
Amid national concern and outrage over sexual crimes against women, Sonia Gandhi, the head of the ruling Congress, said today, ""Our heads hang in shame because of the rapes, crimes that are committed against women in the country.""

In December, the barbarous gang-rape of a medical student on a bus in Delhi united the country in anger and a determination for change. Massive street protests urged the government to introduce tougher anti-rape laws.

The student was airlifted from Delhi to Singapore by the government, where she died of the horrific injuries from her attack.  When her body returned to India, Mrs Gandhi and the Prime Minister received her parents at the airport.

In response to the public outpouring, in February, the government cleared a new package of laws through an ordinance which provide for the death penalty for extreme cases of rape, and recognize stalking and voyeurism as criminal offences that deserve serious punishment.

However, the new laws have yet to be introduced in parliament for approval, because within the government, there are differences over important features, like whether the age of consent for sex should be lowered from 18 to 16.

Women's rights activists point out that while the government is moving slowly, attacks on women appear to be increasing.  Delhi has reported four cases of rape  a day till February 15 this year, twice as many for the same period last year.

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court today allowed the plea of two accused involved in the gang-rape of 'Amanat' (NOT her real name) to use a CD containing the interview of her friend given to a news channel as evidence in the case.

Justice GP Mittal allowed the plea of accused Ram Singh and his brother Mukesh and set aside the trial court's order by which they were not allowed to exhibit the CD of the interview telecast on January 4, as a piece of evidence.

Justice Mittal directed the trial court to ""permit the accused to use the CD as evidence"".

The gang-rape accused, in their plea, had challenged the trial court order which did not allow them to ""exhibit, place on record and to play the impugned CD"" on the ground that this was not an admissible piece of evidence.

The Delhi High Court had reserved its verdict in the case on March 5.

Earlier, the Delhi Police had opposed the accused' plea, saying the media interview of a witness is inadmissible evidence under the law.

The police had objected to the plea of the accused to use the CD as an evidence on the ground that it has been prepared in violation of a Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) provision that restrains media coverage of the trial and inquiry proceedings related to a rape case.

On December 16 last, the 23-year-old medical student was brutally gang-raped and assaulted in a moving bus in south Delhi. She died in a Singapore hospital on December 29.

Besides bus driver Ram Singh and his brother Mukesh, the three other adult accused facing trial in the case are.

Ghaziabad:
""I cried for help for two hours,"" said a school girl to cops about a journey she made in an auto-rickshaw that ended with three men allegedly raping her near National Highway 24 in Ghaziabad, a suburb of Delhi.

Two of the three suspects have been arrested.  

The grim lapses  - the auto rickshaw drove through six police posts while she was pinned in the back by her abductors - mirror those that allowed the fatal gang-rape of a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi in December, shaking India into large protests and pushing the safety of women to the top of the national agenda.

On Saturday night, the girl left a mall in Ghaziabad a little after 8 pm.  She hired an auto-rickshaw which had two men seated in the back.  ""Shared autos"" are illegal but standard practice in this area, because they make commuting cheaper, and because there's a paucity of public transport.

The auto, the police said today, had been stolen by the driver and two of his friends.
For two hours, the auto travelled 25 kms.  When the men had raped the teenager in a secluded area near the highway, they threw her onto the road. But not before robbing her of her cash and cellphone.

Police patrol vans that were on duty did not spot the auto, or the abandoned girl.

She walked to a dhaba or roadside food stall and asked for help.

In December, a 23-year-old medical student left a South Delhi mall with a male friend and boarded a bus on a Sunday night. The bus had been stolen.   It rolled unstopped through police check posts though it had tinted windows, which are illegal.  White lettering on the side declared it a school-bus.  Yet, nobody stopped it to ask why it was on the road at night.
A gang of men on the bus hit Amanat (not her real name) and her friend with an iron rod, raped her, then threw the couple,  naked and bleeding, onto the road.

Since then, the police has said that it has increased patrolling in areas like malls, which are visited frequently by women at night.

But yesterday, a report shared with parliament said this year, the number of rapes reported in Delhi has doubled.  Four cases a day had been reported till February 15.

New Delhi:
Four rapes have been reported in Delhi till the middle of February, almost double the amount of sexual assault cases reported for the same period last year.

181 rapes were reported in Delhi between January and February 15, Minister of State for Home Affairs Mullappally Ramachandran informed parliament today.

The Delhi Police has said that in 2012, rape cases were the highest in ten years.

Last week, a seven-year-old was raped at her school in North West Delhi, triggering violent protests. Nobody has been arrested so far in connection with the case.

Delhi's shameful reputation as the ""rape capital"" of India has been in focus since a young medical student was fatally gang-raped on a moving bus in Delhi after being battered with an iron rod.

Since then, the police has increased patrolling in areas where women are considered vulnerable in the city, and more public transport has been added at night.

New Delhi:
A 25-year-old man arrested for attempting to rape a Class 11 girl and shoving an iron rod into her mouth, was today remanded back in 14 days of judicial custody by a Delhi court.

Anil Kumar, who was taken into custody for attempting to rape and murder the girl after trespassing into her house in South Delhi on February 4 night, was produced after the expiry of his earlier remand before Metropolitan Magistrate Amitabh Rawat who sent him back to judicial custody till March 19.

""On the request of the police, the accused (Anil) is remanded in another 14 days of Judicial Custody. He will be produced on March 19,"" the court said.

The accused, working with a local power distribution company, was arrested on February 5 after a case was lodged against him by family members of the girl.

On the fateful day, the accused had come to the house of the girl to collect monthly electricity dues. Since the girl knew him, she let him inside her house in Lajpat Nagar.

After coming to know that the girl was alone in her house, Anil tried to force himself on her and assaulted her when she resisted, police said.

He inserted a rod into her mouth when she shouted for help and resisted his attempt to rape her, they said.

She sustained severe injuries in her mouth and the attempted strangulation had left bruises all around her neck, police said.

Washington:
United States has selected the 23-year-old Delhi student, who was fatally gang raped in a moving bus, for the International Women of Courage Award.

The award would be presented posthumously by the First Lady Michelle Obama and the Secretary of State John Kerry, on March 8, an official announcement said yesterday.

""For millions of Indian women, her personal ordeal, perseverance to fight for justice, and her family's continued bravery is helping to lift the stigma and vulnerability that drive violence against women,"" the State Department said about her as it announced the awards to be given to 10 women from across the world.

She bravely recorded two police statements while in the hospital, repeatedly called for justice against the six attackers, and stated her will to survive to see justice done, the State Department said.

""Like many Indians inspired by her struggle, she was born into a working class family that invested their hopes and life savings into her dream to pursue medicine.

She had just graduated from a physiotherapy program when her life was cut short,"" said the State Department.

""In the wake of her death just two weeks after the attack, India's civil society began advocating heavily for legislation and social programs to stem gender-based violence in all its forms and to ensure higher rape conviction rates and gender-sensitive law enforcement and justice systems.

Thanks to these efforts, the Indian government has begun to take action to follow through on those demands,"" the State Department said.

The paramedical student was gangraped, beaten and thrown out of a moving bus along with a male friend in Delhi last December, which generated widespread protests and was condemned by various women groups, both in India and abroad.

New Delhi:
Investigators have prepared a sketch of the suspect in connection with the rape of a seven-year-old girl in a municipal school last Thursday, police sources said.

Police, who have questioned over a dozen people on Sunday, are also trying to ascertain who all entered the school in Mongolpuri on the day of the incident after lunch hours, they said.

""The victim had told police that the offender was not a person whom she knows,"" a senior police official said.

No arrest has been made so far in the case.

The Class II student was raped by an unidentified man inside the North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run primary school in Mongolpuri L Block of north-west Delhi on Thursday.

North Delhi Municipal Corporation Commissioner P K Gupta had on Saturday suspended five staff of the school. The suspended officials were school inspector Balraj Singh, principal Neelam Karwal, class teacher Monica Kohli, school attendant Sushila and guard Kailash.

Gupta also constituted a five-member committee to inquire and fix the responsibility in the sexual assault case.

New Delhi:
It has been nearly two weeks since three sisters aged 11, nine, and six were raped and murdered in the Bhandara district of Maharashtra, but in the tiny village where they lived, nobody has been arrested yet. The police admits it has suspects but has not been able to zero in on them due to the lack of eyewitnesses.

In Parliament today, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said, ""It appears that all three (girls) were subjected to sexual abuse before being murdered. The collective conscience of the House, I am sure, is jolted by this.""

His written statement, circulated among parliamentarians and others, named the girls, provoking deep criticism from the BJP.  The identity of sexually assaulted minors has to be protected, according to the law.

After the uproar, the house expunged his remarks and the Home Minister has now ordered a probe on how the names came into his own statement. ""the statement that was made in the house, we withdrew. The deputy chairman also gave  orders (for it to be expunged),""Mr Shinde said.

In Bhandara, sources have confirmed that the autopsy in the case was mishandled, which could impact the trial, if the culprits are caught. Fingernail clippings and hair samples of the girls were not collected, which is a requirement for cases of sexual abuse. The post-mortem was reportedly not correctly filmed, which could also hurt the case in court.

The day that her daughters were found dead, their mother told NDTV, ""I want the culprits to be caught and hanged in public.""

The girls went missing after school on February 14. Their bodies were spotted by a local farmer two days later in a well when he came to water his fields. He then informed the police. The bodies were recovered from the well located just off the major road in the area, the Nagpur-Raipur Highway.

Members of the autopsy team say the police pressured them to hurry with the autopsy. Speaking to NDTV, Bhandara Superintendent of Police Dr Aarti Singh said, ""The police cannot decide who would conduct the post-mortem. If the autopsy team did not have forensic experts to conduct the autopsy, they should have informed us. They are the authority and they should have suggested alternatives.""

New Delhi:
The 17-year-old who was arrested along with five adults after a student was fatally gang-raped on a Delhi bus will be investigated for charges of rape and murder, a juvenile court in Delhi has decided. Hearings will begin on March 6.

The attack on 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name) united India in grief, shock and a campaign for tough new laws to punish crimes against women.

Based on the evidence submitted by the police, which has described him as ""an equal participant in the crime,"" the Juvenile Justice Board will begin the equivalent of a trial- ""an enquiry against the juvenile in conflict with the law.""

Amanat and her male companion were attacked on December 16; she died two weeks later.  Her friend has testified in a special fast-track court that's trying the five adult suspects.  If convicted, they could face the death penalty.

The sixth suspect says he is 17.  The police contested that claim, but school documents were accepted as proof of his age by the Juvenile Justice Board. He has pleaded not guilty.

If he is found guilty he faces a maximum of three years in a reform facility.

The student's family has said that all six suspects must be proven guilty and hanged.

Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari on Friday directed the government to probe the alleged ""manhandling"" of CPI-M member TN Seema by Delhi Police during a protest demanding removal of Deputy Chairman PJ Kurien who is facing charges in the Suryanelli rape case.

Taking a serious note of the matter, members met Mr Ansari in his chamber before the House met for the day seeking his intervention saying Ms Seema is a member of the Rajya Sabha.

Mr Ansari asked the government to submit a report before the next sitting of the House.

""Some members met me this morning and informed that TN Seema, MP, was manhandled yesterday by the Delhi police personnel in a police van. It is a serious matter which relates to the dignity of the member and the prestige of the House.

""I direct the government to inquire into the matter and submit a report before the next sitting of the House,"" Mr Ansari said.

CPI MP D Raja told reporters that the issue was taken up seriously by members of all parties during their meeting with Mr Ansari and even Union Minister Rajiv Shukla described it as a serious matter.

New Delhi:
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) today demanded re-investigation of the 17-year-old Suryanelli gangrape case and sought removal of P J Kurien from the post of Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman following allegations against him in connection with the incident.

""A reinvestigation is essential and Kurien should step down from his post of Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, till it is over,"" CPI(M) Polit Bureau said in a statement here, claiming that ""fresh evidence"" had surfaced in the case.

The Left party said the surfacing of ""fresh evidence"" in the gangrape case concerning the involvement of Kurien comes in the background of the Supreme Court orders annulling the acquittal of 35 men by the Kerala High Court in 2005 and ordering a re-examination of the case.

It said the whole country was agitated about the alarming rise in sexual crimes against women and Parliament was set to discuss laws concerning sexual violence against women.

""At such a juncture, when a rape victim has leveled a serious charge against P J Kurien and fresh evidence has come to light, will it be proper for him to continue in the post of Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha? It becomes incumbent for him to resign. If not, he should be removed from the post of Deputy Chairman,"" it said.

The party said it should be noted that Kurien had got the benefit of a ""flawed judgement"" when his petition not to be included as one of the accused was accepted by the High Court and the Supreme Court in 2007.

It also accused the Kerala Government for ""adopting double standards"" by not ordering a reinvestigation into the case against Kurien.

President Pranab Mukherjee has rejected seven mercy petitions in his seven months in office so far.

Now, the Home Ministry has sent him another seven death row cases for consideration. One of them involves a man who was granted bail in a rape case and killed five members of the victim's family.

The new set of petitions asks for clemency involving nine people. (Read: Mercy petition section removed from President's website)

Yesterday, the president rejected the mercy petitions of four members of sandalwood smuggler Veerappan's gang. They were given the death sentence by the Supreme Court for a landmine blast in Karnataka in 1993 in which 22 policemen were killed.

Earlier this month, Kashmiri Afzal Guru was hanged and buried at Delhi's Tihar Jail after the president rejected a petition filed by his wife requesting that his sentence be commuted to life in prison.

In November, Pakistani terrorist Ajmal Kasab, convicted for 2008's terror strikes in Mumbai was hanged.

Various human rights groups have criticised India for the executions. After Afzal Guru was hanged on February 9 Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director of Human Rights Watch, said it ""opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as an inherently irreversible, inhumane punishment.""

New Delhi:
Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari today said his colleague and Minister for Overseas Indian Affairs Vayalar Ravi had apologised for his deeply offensive comments made to a woman journalist, when she asked him about the allegations against PJ Kurien in the Suryanelli rape case, and the matter should rest there.

Mr Tewari said the remark was unbecoming for someone working in the public sphere, but since Mr Ravi had apologised and withdrawn his words, the matter should be put to rest.

A woman journalist in Kerala had on Monday sought Mr Ravi's reaction on the demand for a re-investigation of Deputy Chairperson of Rajya Sabha PJ Kurien's role in the Suryanelli rape case. Vayalar Ravi responded with a personal swipe at the reporter, asking if she had a personal grudge against Mr Kurien.

""Do you have anything personal against PJ Kurien? I am sure you do. Has something happened between you and him in the past?"" Mr Ravi had asked the woman journalist. The comments were caught on camera.

""Such a comment is not expected from anyone in the public sphere,"" Manish Tewari told women journalists at the Indian Women Press Corps in Delhi. ""To the best of my knowledge, he has retracted the comments and expressed regret. Let us leave it there.""

Commenting on the allegations against Mr Kurien, Mr Tewari said the matter is being sensationalised and the legal procedure would be followed.

The Suryanelli case gets its name from the place in Kerala's Idukki district from where the gang-rape survivor hailed. In January 1996, when she was 16, she was abducted and raped by 42 men over 40 days.

Last month, the Supreme Court ordered a retrial in the Kerala High Court, setting aside the acquittal in 2005 of all but one of the 35 accused.

The woman, now 32, and her family have consistently maintained that Congress leader PJ Kurien should stand trial in the case as he was among those who exploited her. They allege that Mr Kurien was shielded from the law because of his political influence.

Mr Kurien has denied the allegations and said that the Supreme Court has cleared him.

New Delhi:
A special fast-track court will continue its hearing in the Delhi gang-rape case, where five of the six accused are being tried for charges of rape and murder of a medical student.

The court is expected to decide on a plea by the defence lawyers in the case, on whether an interview given by the girl's male friend to a news channel can be used in the court of law.

Last week, the court heard the testimonies of doctors who had examined the five suspects after their arrest. The medical student's friend, who had accompanied her in the bus, had also testified and was cross-examined by defence lawyers.

The five suspects, who have been charged with gang-rape, murder, kidnapping and robbery, have pleaded not guilty. The sixth accused in the case, who has been declared a juvenile by a Juvenile Justice Board in the city, will be tried separately later this month.  

The trial is being held in-camera, meaning the media cannot report the day-to-day proceedings in detail.

Police say 'Amanat' (NOT her real name) was gang-raped and assaulted with an iron rod by the accused on December 16 in a moving bus which she had boarded along with her friend, a software engineer. Her friend was also assaulted. They were then thrown out of the bus, unclothed and bleeding on the road.

Amanat died in a Singapore hospital on December 29. Her family has demanded death penalty for all accused, including the juvenile. They said it would be a travesty of justice if the juvenile is let-off with a minimum punishment because of his age.

New Delhi:
A college student in Delhi has gone through two operations since an iron rod was shoved down her throat by a man who tried to rape her.

The assault on the 19-year-old student in her home in Lajpat Nagar in South Delhi shook the capital, where two months ago, a medical student was fatally gang-raped and hit by an iron rod on a moving bus, triggering massive protests and new anti-rape laws.

On Monday night, an electrician who was known to the student in Lajpat Nagar forced his way into her apartment and tried to rape her. When she shouted for help, he pushed an iron rod into her mouth to silence her. But her neighbours, who had heard her cries, rushed over and moved her to hospital.  The electrician has been arrested.

The next day, Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit referred to the Lajpat Nagar assault and said, ""Women still do not feel safe in Delhi.""


""The doctors have performed two surgeries on her throat, but still she can't speak. Otherwise her condition is better now,"" a senior police official told news agency IANS.

""The women has been admitted to AIIMS. She is likely to be discharged in the next two days,"" the official said.

West Delhi Lok Sabha member Mahabal Mishra and his family, who were summoned in a 2006 rape case, today failed to make an appearance in a city court.

The Congress leader's lawyers told the court he was away for the Kumbh and sought an exemption. The court directed Mr Mishra and the others to appear before it on February 18.

A 16-year-old girl raped in 2006 had alleged that she was abducted and forcibly kept at Mr Mishra's office and his brother's home. She said his family tried to force her to marry the rape suspect, Pradeep Sehrawat.

A special fast-track court for sexual offences against women had issued a notice to Mr Mishra, wife Urmila, daughter Kiran and son Hira to make an appearance on February 8.

The trial court had initially said there was not enough evidence to summon the politician and his family. The Delhi High Court overruled the decision, saying the girl's statement was prima facie enough.

Johannesburg:
A 17-year-old South African girl has died of injuries received in a gang rape at the weekend, provoking rare cries of outrage on Wednesday in a country with a high level of sexual violence.

In an echo of the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus in December, the Cape Town-based Cape Argus newspaper said the victim was sliced open from her stomach to her genitals. She was dumped on a building site in the town of Bredasdorp, 130 km (80 miles) east of Cape Town.

The Indian case triggered protests against endemic anti-female violence. But the Bredasdorp murder is unlikely to provoke a similar outpouring of anger in South Africa, where women's groups say rape has lost the power to shock.

""It is difficult to find reason behind the many different acts of gang rape, child rape, rape of the elderly, corrective rape and male rape,"" the Women's League of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) said in a statement.

A day after an irod rod was shoved down the throat of a student shouting for help while a man tried to rape her, Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said, ""Women don't feel safe in Delhi."" She said ""fears have risen"" after yesterday's assault in South Delhi.

The vulnerability of women in Delhi has been an impassioned national debate since the fatal gang-rape of a 23-year-old on a bus in Delhi in December.  Five men are being tried for her gang-rape and murder at a fast-track court.

The heinous assault triggered large protests and outrage; the Delhi government launched a helpline (181) for women in distress, whose performance has been spotty. Many who tried calling it were put on hold.  Others said the helpline rang out.

Yesterday, a college student in Lajpat Nagar was alone at home when an electrician forced his way into the house and tried to rape her. She tried to defend herself with an iron rod; he pushed the weapon down her throat when she began shouting for help.  He ran away soon after, and her neighbours, who had heard her screams, rushed her to hospital.

The police and government have promised a litany of new measures to improve security for women in India's ""rape capital."" More public buses are being added at night, the licenses of their drivers will be displayed.  Additional police vans will patrol Delhi.

Ms Dikshit has called for urgent police reforms to sensitize those responsible for law enforcement.  After December's gang-rape, she said that Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar should quit. The Delhi Police reports not to the chief minister but to the Lieutenant Governor of the city, Tejinder Khanna.

New Delhi:
For the second day in a row, the companion of the medical student who was fatally gang-raped on a bus in Delhi was in court today. Yesterday, he testified as a witness for the prosecution against the five men who have pleaded not guilty to charges including rape and murder.  Today, their lawyers cross-examined the software engineer who uses a wheelchair because of the injuries inflicted on him in the heinous attack.  His cross-examination will continue tomorrow.

The trial of the case that spurred massive protests and calls for tougher anti-rape laws and better protection for women is being conducted in-camera or behind closed doors at a fast-track court in Delhi, very near the mall where the student and her friend watched 'Life of Pi' before boarding the bus which turned into a crime scene of unmitigated horror.

The police says a gang of six men attacked the engineer with an iron rod and threw him to the back of the bus before taking turns to rape the 23-year-old student. The couple was then thrown naked and bleeding on the road. In a television interview, the student's friend said that he heard the men discussing whether to run her over which prompted him to push her out of their way.

Amanat (NOT her real name) died in a Singapore hospital two weeks later; before she was flown out of the country, she recorded her testimony for a magistrate from bed in the Intensive Care Unit of a Delhi hospital.

The five men being tried for gang-rape and murder face the death penalty, if convicted. A sixth suspect is being tried separately as a juvenile, and faces a maximum sentence of three years in a reform facility, a punishment described as a travesty by Amanat's family.  ""We want all the six men hanged,"" her father said yesterday.

The government fumbled in its response to anger and grief that spread across India after the gang-rape. Last week, to telegraph its determination to tackle crimes against women more effectively, the government introduced an ordinance which toughens anti-rape laws.  The ordinance, which is effective immediately, allows the death sentence for cases of rape which leave the victim dead or in a coma.  

Activists have dismissed the ordinance as hurried and incomplete, largely because it ignores many of the recommendations of a commission of three legal experts, who submitted their report to the government last month. Headed by former Chief Justice JS Verma, the commission did not recommend the death penalty even for extreme rape cases; it asked for marital rape to be recognized as a criminal offence and for members of the armed forces to be tried in regular courts for sexual crimes. The government has not included these recommendations in its ordinance.

The trial of five men accused of raping and murdering a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi began today with the student's companion, a software engineer, testifying against them in court.   

Before the student was raped, the engineer, who was with her on the bus, was hit so badly with an iron rod that he is still unable to walk properly. He arrived at court in a wheelchair, escorted by his father. ""My son will go to any lengths to ensure the guilty are punished,"" he told news agency AFP.

The bus used in the attack that stunned and horrified India, triggering massive protests and new anti-rape laws,  was brought to the court complex today for identification by the software engineer. Tomorrow, he will be cross-examined by defence lawyers.

The case is being heard in a special fast-track court.  The judge has banned all reporting of proceedings inside the courtroom.

On Saturday, the five suspects pleaded not guilty in court to the charges against them. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. A sixth, who is a juvenile, is being tried separately and faces a maximum sentence of three years in a reform facility.

The student's father expressed his family's unhappiness with that at a press conference in another part of the capital. ""We want all six men to be hanged,"" he said. (Read: She died but awakened the nation, says medical student's father)

Before she died, 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name) recorded her testimony for a judge; for the prosecution, her statement along with that of her friend's, will be crucial.

In a television interview, the engineer has said that over an hour after the attack on them began, the couple was thrown from the bus onto the road. He said that the gang on the bus wanted to run the student over, but he pushed her out of the way.

Seeking better policing, Ms Dikshit also sought deployment of women police personnel at all police stations to encourage women to lodge their complaints without any apprehensions.

""My government will do everything possible to provide a conducive atmosphere for the women in the city,"" Ms Dikshit said while chairing a meeting called to discuss issues relating to safety of women.

The meeting was attended by Women and Child Welfare Minister Kiran Walia, Planning Commission member Sayeeda Hamid, Chairperson of Delhi Commission for Women Barkha Singh, representatives of leading NGOs and Women Rights Groups and top officials of government departments.

Ms Dikshit said Delhi government's helpline - 181- has been receiving around 2,000 calls daily and an effective coordination has been established with the police to redress the grievances.

She said the government has started discussion with a security company called 'e-move' to help women in contacting police and other agencies to lodge any complaint.

Emphasising the need for better regulation of public transport, she said specific steps will be initiated to ensure safe environment for women in buses, autos and taxis.

""It has been suggested to train conductors and drivers on being polite with the passengers. The training must be continuous and it should be institutionalized,"" she said.

Thorough verification of the crew of all public transport vehicles, installation of GPS devices and appointment of lady police personnel are some of the measures the Centre had unveiled yesterday to improve safety of women in the city.

Officials said Delhi government will issue a draft notification for revising the permit conditions for public transport vehicles incorporating provisions for disallowing use of inappropriate films and tinted glasses, higher punishment for repeat offences and a number of other measures.

The final notification will be issued within a month.

Ms Dikshit said that at the request of her government five fast track courts have been constituted and they have started working but sought more such courts.

The issue of auto drivers refusing to take passengers was also discussed in the meeting and the Chief Minister promised to look into the matter.

A suggestion was also made to have more hostels for working women.

On providing help to the family of the December 16 gang-rape victim, Ms Dikshit said her government has offered a flat to them in Dwarka. She said an employment for brother of the girl is being tried sincerely.

Ms Dikshit said concerned departments of Delhi government have been told to make efforts to improve the safety of women.

The meeting also decided to bring out a booklet on women safety.

The book would be launched on March 8 which is International Women's Day.

A number of speakers suggested that a book on moral values be brought out for school students.

New Delhi:
The trial of five men accused of raping and murdering a medical student on a moving bus in Delhi began today with the student's companion, a software engineer, testifying against them in court.   

Before the student was raped, the engineer, who was with her on the bus, was hit so badly with an iron rod that he is still unable to walk properly. He arrived at court in a wheelchair, escorted by his father. ""My son will go to any lengths to ensure the guilty are punished,"" he told news agency AFP.

The bus used in the attack that stunned and horrified India, triggering massive protests and new anti-rape laws,  was brought to the court complex today for identification by the software engineer. Tomorrow, he will be cross-examined by defence lawyers.

The case is being heard in a special fast-track court.  The judge has banned all reporting of proceedings inside the courtroom.

On Saturday, the five suspects pleaded not guilty in court to the charges against them. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. A sixth, who is a juvenile, is being tried separately and faces a maximum sentence of three years in a reform facility.

The student's father expressed his family's unhappiness with that at a press conference in another part of the capital. ""We want all six men to be hanged,"" he said.    (Read: She died but awakened the nation, says medical student's father)


Before she died, 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name) recorded her testimony for a judge; for the prosecution, her statement along with that of her friend's, will be crucial.

In a television interview, the engineer has said that over an hour after the attack on them began, the couple was thrown from the bus onto the road. He said that the gang on the bus wanted to run the student over, but he pushed her out of the way.

New Delhi:
As the trial of five men for raping and murdering his daughter began at a special court in Delhi, the father of the medical student said at a press conference, ""I have not been able to sleep for three days.""

The five men pleaded not guilty on Saturday to the charges against them.  A sixth suspect, a juvenile, is being tried separately and faces a maximum sentence of three years in a reform facility.  ""I don't read newspapers or watch TV. I only think that all six people should be hanged,"" the student's father said. ""Don't call my daughter a gang-rape victim,"" he urged, ""call her 'the country's daughter'.""

The press conference was called by local BJP leaders who have dedicated a science museum to the 23-year-old who was raped, allegedly by six men, on a moving bus in Delhi in December.  She died two weeks later in hospital.  The scale of the assault on her triggered a campaign by students and women activists for stricter anti-rape laws and faster trials for those accused of crimes against women.

On Friday, the government introduced changes to criminal laws through an ordinance that has been rejected by activists as a PR move to counter criticism of the government's fumbling reaction to the massive protests that flooded the streets of Delhi and other cities after the gang-rape.

The ordinance -which is effective immediately and must be cleared by Parliament within six weeks- deviates sharply from the recommendations of the Justice Verma commission, which was appointed by the government to review existing laws.  The three-member panel of legal experts did not suggest the death penalty for rape, but the new ordinance allows it for extreme cases. The government also ignored the suggestion to recognise marital rape as a criminal offence, and allow the prosecution of members of the armed forces accused of sexual crimes in regular courts.

The software engineer who tried to stop his friend, a medical student, from being gang-raped on a bus in Delhi in December arrived in court this morning in a wheelchair. He will testify today again in a special fast-track court against the five men accused of raping and murdering the student, who died two weeks after the horrific assault which triggered massive protests in India, and new anti-rape laws, introduced  by the government a few days ago.

The five suspects on Saturday pleaded not guilty to the charges that were read out to them.  If convicted, they could face the death penalty. A sixth, who is a juvenile, is being tried separately and faces a maximum sentence of three years in a reform facility.

The engineer, whose leg was seriously injured allegedly when the men on the bus hit him with an iron rod, will testify in court as the main witness for the prosecution today. The police says that when he tried to stop the gang, they  hit him repeatedly and forced him to the back of the bus before they took turns raping the student.
 
Before she died, 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name) recorded her testimony for a judge; for the prosecution, her statement along with that of her friend's, will be crucial.

Amanat's friend has said that when three police vans arrived, the cops argued about who should take charge of the case and which hospital the couple should be moved to.

Protests after the gang-rape
New Delhi:
The trial of the five men accused of gang-raping and murdering a medical student on a bus in Delhi will formally start today. The prosecution has called four witnesses, including a software engineer who was with her and tried to protect her from the men. The police says the gang then turned on him with an iron rod and forced her to the back of the bus before they took turns raping the student.

The savagery of the assault - the couple was thrown naked and bleeding onto the road- sent shock waves through India, which realigned its anger and grief into street protests demanding better policing for women, stricter anti-rape laws, and swift justice for the student who died in a hospital in Singapore two weeks after the gang-rape.

Before she died, 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name) recorded her testimony for a judge; for the prosecution, her statement along with that of her friend's, will be crucial.

The five suspects on Saturday pleaded not guilty to the charges that were read out to them. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. A sixth, who is a juvenile, is being tried separately and faces a maximum sentence of three years in a reform facility. Amanat's family says this is a travesty.

Among the other witnesses scheduled to appear in court tomorrow is a guard who was on his way to work at the Delhi-Gurgaon toll plaza when he saw the couple lying bleeding on the road, and phoned the police for help.

Amanat's friend has said that when three police vans arrived, the cops argued about who should take charge of the case and which hospital the couple should be moved to.

In response, the Delhi High Court recently ordered the police to ensure that jurisdiction must not stop a police officer from taking charge of a crime and that those injured must be rushed to the nearest hospital, irrespective of whether it's run by the state or privately-owned.

New Delhi:
In Kerala, a campaign is surging for an investigation against PJ Kurien, the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, to determine whether he is linked to one of the state's most depraved cases of rape where a teenager was allegedly raped by 42 men in 40 days in 1996.  

Mr Kurien has been exonerated by the Kerala High Court, and then by the Supreme Court in 2007 in the Suryanelli rape case, named for the part of Kerala that the woman belongs to.

The woman, who was just 16 when she was abducted and sexually assaulted, says that despite her naming Mr Kurien as one of her rapists, he has not been investigated by the police.  New shrill calls for an assessment of Mr Kurien's alleged role are being made by his political opponents after the Supreme Court last week said that that the Kerala High Court, which had acquitted 34 men of raping the woman, must re-consider the evidence and deliver a verdict within six months.  

""Believe me; I have never ever seen this girl in all my life. I have no clue why she is saying this again and again,"" said Mr Kurien to local media over the weekend.  ""The apex court exonerated me after dismissing all the arguments against me. What more should I do?""

The woman has written to the Kerala Home Minister and Leader of the Opposition VS Achuthanandan, seeking their assistance.  ""Yes, yes, Kurien exploited me. Despite the fact that I brought the matter to the notice of the police probe team, Kurien was not included in the list of accused. I don't want to see him again. I wish to see him in court,"" the woman said on a local TV channel over the weekend, according to news agency IANS. 

In the Kerala Assembly today, members of the opposition CPI (M) caused chaos as they targeted Mr Kurien, forcing an adjournment. (Read: Kerala Assembly session adjourned after ruckus over Suryanelli rape case)

New Delhi:
Law Minister Ashwani Kumar has rejected the allegations made by several women's rights groups who say that the union government has selectively accepted the recommendations of the Justice JS Verma commission on rape laws. The minister insists that the government has in fact accepted 90 per cent of the suggestions made by the panel and has hence has done justice to the report.

""We have accepted 90 per cent of Justice Verma's recommendations. It may be a difference in perception and interpretation. But let me tell you we have actually responded with the utmost sensitivity to the recommendations of the panel, because we do appreciate and we know that a lot of effort had gone into proposing those recommendations, but at the end of the day the government is entitled in its wisdom to take a holistic view of the entire gamut of issues,"" Mr Kumar told NDTV.

Many women groups have rejected the government's ordinance on rape laws, calling it a ""betrayal"" and have urged the president not to sign it. ""The present piecemeal and fragmented ordinance can only serve to sabotage the intention of providing recourse to victims of sexual violence. AIDWA feels that the government would have done better to move for amendments in Parliament,"" the All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) said in a statement yesterday.

The Verma commission, a panel of three legal experts, was appointed after in the wake of fierce street protests after the gang-rape of a medical student in Delhi in December. It submitted its report in just 29 days. After Justice Verma urged the government to match his team's commitment by implementing the changes urgently, the Prime Minister had sent him a letter stating, ""On behalf of our government, I assure you that we will be prompt in pursuing the recommendations of the committee.""


On Friday, the government brought in the ordinance to introduce stricter penalties for crimes against women, including death in extreme cases.

But it ignored many key suggestions of the commission, such as criminalising marital rape, reviewing the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) and trying military personnel accused of sexual offences under criminal law, and barring politicians facing such cases from contesting elections.

Minister of State for Home, RPN Singh, has however assured that the ordinance was not final. ""The standing committee is going to see all the recommendations of the Verma commission. We will discuss these recommendations. The government is aware that we need stringent laws to protect women,"" he said.

The ordinance will come into effect as soon as the President signs it. Parliament has to pass it within six months.

Five men arrested for the fatal gang-rape in Delhi are being tried at a fast-track court in Delhi. A sixth, who has been declared a minor, will be tried separately by a juvenile court.

The government has brought in an ordinance to introduce stricter penalties for crimes against women, including death in extreme cases, but ignored the Justice JS Verma commission's recommendations on criminalising marital rape and reviewing controversial sections of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA).

The ordinance introduced yesterday is also silent on the recommendation to bar politicians facing charges of sexual offences from contesting elections. (Read: Ordinance vs Verma commission recommendations)

The Justice Verma commission had suggested that marital rape should be made an offence, a key demand of women's rights activists. It also observed that sexual violence was being legitimised under AFSPA and suggested that such crimes by members of the armed forces be tried under ordinary criminal law.

The ordinance incorporates some but not all recommendations of the commission, a panel of three legal experts appointed in the wake of fierce street protests after the gang-rape of a medical student in Delhi last month.

The Justice Verma commission is against death penalty in rape cases and recommends a maximum punishment of life in jail. But the government has favoured capital punishment in rare cases.

""Women's security is the government's priority. We have introduced the ordinance within eight days of the Justice Verma committee submitting its report,"" said RPN Singh, Minister of State for Home.

The ordinance will come into effect as soon as the President signs it. Parliament has to pass it within six months. The Verma commission put together its report in just 29 days. Justice Verma had urged the government to match his team's commitment by implementing the changes urgently.

Earlier this week, the Prime Minister sent him a letter stating, ""On behalf of our government, I assure you that we will be prompt in pursuing the recommendations of the committee.""

Five men arrested for the fatal gang-rape are being tried at a fast-track court in Delhi. A sixth, who has been declared a minor, will be tried separately by a juvenile court.

New Delhi:
The government has decided not to wait for Parliament to clear tough new anti-rape laws, the subject of national debate after the fatal gang-rape of a young student on a Delhi bus in December. Instead, the government has brought in an ordinance that introduces tougher jail terms for crimes against women, including the death penalty for extreme cases of sexual assault.

The ordinance comes into effect as as soon as the president signs it. The Parliament has to pass the ordinance within six months. The Budget Session of Parliament starts on February 21.

The ordinance incorporates some but not all of the recommendations of the Justice Verma commission, a panel of three legal experts, appointed by the government in the wake of fierce street protests after the Delhi gang-rape. (Read Ordinance vs Verma commission recommendations)

The panel which was headed by former chief justice JS Verma did not ask for the death penalty even for extreme cases of rape, largely because women's groups were not in favour of it. Though the committee recommended that marital rape be recognized as a crime, it does not feature in the ordinance which also replaces the word ""rape"" with the term ""sexual assault"" and includes acid attacks and stalking.  

The ordinance also does not include any reference to a review of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act or AFSPA -the commission had suggested that sexual crimes by members of the armed forces should be tried under ordinary criminal law.

Justice Verma, who is 80, delivered his report within 29 days and urged the government to match his team's commitment by implementing the changes urgently.  Earlier this week, the Prime Minister sent him a letter stating, ""On behalf of our government, I assure you that we will be prompt in pursuing the recommendations of the committee.""

New Delhi:
After national outrage over the gang-rape of a medical student on a Delhi bus last month, the government has decided to issue an ordinance that implements tougher jail terms for sexual offenders, as recommended by the Justice JS Verma Commission.

Named for the retired chief justice who was its chair, the Verma committee recently recommended major revisions of the laws that deal with crimes against women. The ordinance will enact tougher jail terms for sexual offenders, including life imprisonment that ""should mean the rest of the person's life"" for extreme rape cases.

Parliament is scheduled to meet on February 21 for its budget session.  The ordinance allows for the changes to be enacted before Parliament debates the 600-page report of the Verma commission, which was readied in just 29 days.  Justice Verma, who is 80, had urged the government to match his team's commitment by implementing the changes urgently.  Earlier this week, the Prime Minister sent him a letter stating, ""On behalf of our government, I assure you that we will be prompt in pursuing the recommendations of the committee.""

Five men have been arrested for the fatal gang-rape and are being tried at a fast-track court in Delhi. A sixth who says he is 17 is being tried separately at a juvenile court.

The barbarous gang-rape provoked fierce street protests with thousands of students vowing they would fight for better policing and tougher anti-rape laws.  As public anger surged, the government appointed the Justice Verma commission to review existing laws.

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court has ordered the government to ensure that all hospitals, including those that are privately owned, provide urgent medical attention to rape survivors or those injured in road accidents.  Hospitals must be told they cannot refuse treatment in these cases, the court said.

The directions come after the fatal gang-rape of a medical student who was thrown onto the road from a moving bus along with her friend, who had also been assaulted by six men.  After the student died, her friend, a software engineer, has said that when the couple was found bleeding and naked on the roadside, the policemen who showed up spent precious time arguing over which police station should take charge of the case, while also debating which state-run hospital was nearest.  

Those revelations have added to the anger and outrage over the monstrous attack. Five men are being tried for the rape and murder of Amanat (NOT her real name). A sixth, who says he is 17, is being tried separately at a juvenile court.

The court today said that the police must be given clear instructions to take those injured to the nearest hospital ""without any debate"" to identify a government hospital that is nearby.

""Why can't you consider issuing standing instructions to all hospitals to treat victims brought to them without any delay?"" the court told the police. ""A hospital should not delay treatment on any grounds. If the hospital is a small hospital, at least they should give first aid to the victims before sending them elsewhere,"" the court said.

Washington:
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who will retire in on Friday, hopes to see ""big changes"" in India following the horrific gang rape of a student last month in New Delhi.

""The young woman who essentially was raped and then died of her terrible injuries, who knows what she could have contributed to India's future?"" she said Tuesday in a ""global townhall.""  She was responding to questions from young Indians and NDTV's Barkha Dutt, one of six news anchors selected from around the world for the townhall.

""I personally was very encouraged and even proud to see young men and young women out in the streets protesting the way that young women are treated by men who do not understand or have never been taught to accept that it's not just their sisters and their mothers that they should respect, but all girls and women,"" she said.

""So I'm looking for big changes in India in the years to come,"" added Clinton.

""Although it is better than it was,"" she said women still face ""a double standard that exists from the trivial, like what you wear, to the incredibly serious, like women can't vote, women can't run for office, women are not supposed to be in the public sphere.""

""But there is a spectrum of the double standard, and of the both legal and cultural barriers to respect for women, for the full participation of women.""

""So we do have a ways to go, and even in democracies"" like India ""where women have achieved a lot of political success,"" Clinton said.

""There is still a tremendous amount of discrimination and just outright abuse of women, particularly uneducated women, women who can't stand up for themselves, but clearly, even as we saw in the terrible gang rape, a woman trying to better herself, go to school.""

This has been the cause of her life, Clinton said, ""and will continue to be as I leave the Secretary of State's office, because we are hurting ourselves.""

New Delhi:
A Juvenile Justice Board ruled on Monday that one of the six accused in the Delhi gang-rape case is indeed a juvenile and will be tried in the case as a minor. The family of the medical student, who was allegedly raped by the six people, said they would challenge the ""unfortunate"" decision as all six of the accused men should be hanged.

""To leave somebody who did this to us is also a crime. We will go to court. We will do everything that we need to do,"" the girl's father said after the Juvenile Justice Board's decision.

""The punishment should not be less even if he is a juvenile. They all deserve the same punishment. They all should be hanged,"" he said.

The girl's brother told the Press Trust of India that the family would consult legal experts and ""challenge the matter in the relevant court.""

""The family is not ready to accept that the sixth accused get anything less than death penalty,"" he said.

The six men are accused of gang-raping and brutally murdering a 23-year-old medical student in a moving bus on December 16 last year. The incident sparked outrage in the country and people took to the streets to demand the most stringent punishment for the accused. Many have demanded the death penalty.

'Amanat' (NOT her real name) fought for her life in hospital for 13 days, but her injuries were too severe and she died in a Singapore hospital on December 29.

All the accused were arrested within days of the horrific assault. The case was committed to a fast-track court on January 17.

Colombo:
In a case similar to the Delhi gang-rape, a 47-year-old woman was allegedly raped by four auto drivers near a Colombo suburb in Sri Lanka evoking a similar sentiment of outrage.

Police spokesman Prishantha Jayakody said they arrested two of the accused men yesterday after a witness raised an alarm and the authorities were looking for two more suspects.

""The victim has been admitted to hospital,"" Jayakody said adding that the men had attacked her when she went to a taxi stand to ask for directions after losing her bearings in the Mirihana suburb of Colombo on Wednesday night.

A women's rights group, Lak Vanitha, or Lankan women, said they were staging a demonstration later today outside a police station in the same area where the unidentified woman was attacked by the drivers.

""We have about 1,400 rapes recorded each year in Sri Lanka,"" Lak Vanitha chief Shanthinie Kongahage told PTI.

""The actual number should be much more. Most victims are afraid to report because of social stigma or out of fear of more violence,"" she said adding, ""We are pressing the police to ensure a speedy investigation and a quick prosecution.""

She said the international publicity surrounding the Delhi gang-rape last month had inspired her group to raise the issue locally and create more awareness in the local community.

""Lot of women are harassed by three wheel drivers,"" she said referring to the ubiquitous autorickshaws which have become an alternative to poor public transport.

""We need to take a stand and say enough is enough,"" she said.

The 23-year-old Indian gang-rape victim who died of her injuries has touched a nerve in neighbouring Sri Lanka where activists have expressed solidarity with Indian women facing sexual violence.

The Chief Minister also told him that Delhi government would help the family in education of their two sons and make them earning members.

The physiotherapy student was brutally gangraped and assaulted in a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16. She died in a Singapore hospital on December 29.

New Delhi:
In a fast-track court in Delhi today the five men accused of raping and murdering a young woman on a bus last month heard the charges against them. On Monday, the defence lawyers will counter those charges.

Of the six men arrested for the crime, one is being tried separately by a juvenile court as he claims he is under 18. Another man last week claimed that he too is under-age, and wants a bone ossification test to prove that he should not be tried as an adult. The fast-track court will decide on his petition on Monday.

Defence lawyers have also asked the Supreme Court for the trial to be moved from Delhi, where they contend the overwhelming public sentiment eliminates a fair trial for their clients.

The monstrous scale of the attack on the student forced thousands of Indians into the streets, demanding swift justice for Amanat, who died in a Singapore hospital on December 29, and an overhaul of the laws that handle sexual crimes. As a result of the public call to action, the government announced that Amanat's case would be handled by a special fast track court with daily hearings.

A committee of legal experts was commissioned to study the existing laws for crimes against women. Its report submitted yesterday said there has been a systemic failure in protecting women and their rights. The commission did not recommend the death penalty for rapists, but wants tougher jail sentences like a life sentence for extreme cases of sexual assault for ""the rest of the convict's natural life."" Currently, convicts sentenced to life in prison are often released after 14 years in jail.

In Delhi today, women activists on a pink bus were driving to the court-house from the bus-stop where the horrific journey for the student began on December 16.

New Delhi:
The trial of five men accused in the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a Delhi bus last month is set to begin in a special fast-track court in New Delhi.

The men, who have been charged with rape and murder, were brought to the sprawling court complex in South Delhi at noon.  The court is expected to hear opening arguments by the prosecution and defence lawyers

A sixth suspect claims to be a juvenile and is expected to be tried in a juvenile court.

The barbarous assault prompted weeks of angry protests by thousands of people in Delhi and other cities, who demanded swift justice for Amanat, faster trials for rape cases, and harsher punishment for sexual crimes.

In Delhi, women activists on a pink bus were driving to the court-house from the bus-stop where the horrific journey for the student began on December 16.

'Amanat' (NOT her real name and her boyfriend boarded the bus, after they were led to believe that it was a charter bus, used commonly in Delhi as public transport.  They were then assaulted with an iron rod before the men allegedly took turns raping her, the police says. The couple was later thrown from the bus, and managed to escape an attempt by the men to run them over. Amanat (NOT her real name) died two weeks later from the horrific injuries of her attack.

A committee of legal experts set up by the government to suggest amendments to existing laws submitted its report yesterday.  The commission, headed by Justice JS Verma, has asked for sweeping changes, but has not recommended the death penalty for rapists.  Instead, the panel suggests that the maximum sentence for rapists should be life imprisonment ""which shall mean for the rest of the convict's natural life."" Currently, convicts sentenced to life in prison are often released after 14 years in jail.

New Delhi:
The Justice JS Verma committee, which has said that ""failure of governance"" is the root cause for sexual crime, has put the ball for action in the government's court by meeting a tough 30-day deadline to submit its recommendations on changes in law.  

It said it ensured its report was compiled swiftly so that it can be considered by Parliament in next month's budget session. Senior minister Kamal Nath told NDTV in Davos yesterday that, ""the government will bring a bill to reflect the Verma committee's suggestions on women's safety in the Budget Session if it can.""

The group of three legal experts set up after December 24 amid massive protests over last month's gang-rape of a student on a Delhi bus, has proposed sweeping changes to existing laws for sexual crimes but has not recommended the death penalty for rapists.

In its report submitted on Wednesday, the committee has said the maximum sentence for gang-rape should be raised to a full life term, meaning convicts must spend the rest of their lives behind bars.

""We did not recommend the death penalty because we received overwhelming suggestions against it,"" said Justice Verma, who retired as Chief Justice of India. He also rejected calls for lowering the maximum age for juvenile offenders to 16 from 18, saying it would not help prevent crimes.

The committee said it has focused on preventing sexual crimes rather than just prescribing punishments. Justice Verma attributed the widespread abuse of women to government, police and public apathy. He said there had been a ""shocking"" lack of contributions to the panel's deliberations from the police.

The committee cited ""the failure of good governance"" and the poor implementation of existing laws, as it suggested major new changes including time-bound trials for rape cases and the need for stronger punishment for all forms of sexual harassment including stalking, and groping. The committee has also suggested a review of the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) in conflict areas so that sexual offences by those in uniform are brought under ordinary criminal law.

Justice Verma praised the massive demonstrations organised by thousands of young people after the 23-year-old student and her boyfriend were assaulted with unimaginable depravity on a Delhi bus in December. ""Youth has taught us what we, the older generation, were not aware of. I was struck by the peaceful manner in which the protests were carried out...the youth rose to the occasion,"" he said. (Read: Justice Verma panel recommendations)

After the gang-rape that outraged India, Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar dismissed suggestions that he should accept responsibility and resign. The police was publicly praised by Home Secretary RK Singh for arresting six men who allegedly attacked the student. ""I was shocked that the Police Commissioner got a pat on the back by the Home Secretary. I was so shocked. The least I would have done was to seek an apology for the failure of my duty to protect citizens,"" Justice Verma said.

New Delhi:
A special fast-track court handling the trial of five men accused of raping and murdering a medical student in Delhi last month will start hearing arguments to frame charges in the case today. The five accused have been produced in the court.

The court has decided that the trial will be held in-camera or behind closed doors to ensure safety to the accused and also keeping in mind the sensitive nature of the case. The trial technically begins only after the court frames charges against the accused.

It will also take up an application filed by the lawyer of one of the accused, Vinay, who claims to be a juvenile. As per police records, Vinay - a gym instructor - is an adult and is 20 years old. The court will decide on whether a bone marrow test needs to be conducted on him to determine his age.

The special fast-track court was commissioned a few weeks ago to handle this case and others involving crimes against women. If convicted, the five men could face the death penalty.

In mid-December, they allegedly took a school bus out for a spin, pretending to be a charter bus that ferries passengers in Delhi, and attacked 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name) and her male friend with an iron rod after the couple bought tickets. They then allegedly took turns raping Amanat before throwing her with her friend onto the road. They wanted to run her over, the police has claimed, but her friend pushed her out of the way.

A sixth suspect in the crime which pierced India's conscience and provoked weeks of protests claims he is 17 and is being tried in the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB), where the maximum sentence he faces is three years at a reform facility. The board is expected to given an order today on whether the juvenile accused can be prosecuted along with the other five accused.

The pre-trial proceedings were handled by a city court that ruled the proceedings would be off-limits to the media and to anyone, partly because the prosecutors emphasised that the men arrested for the crime could be attacked while being brought to court.

But defence lawyers want the court to be opened to the public. They have also asked the Supreme Court to move the trial out of Delhi, where they say their clients cannot get a fair trial because the government and the judiciary are feeling the weight of tremendous public pressure.

The Supreme Court will take up the plea on Tuesday.

Ahmedabad:
In Delhi today, as a committee of legal experts stressed the need to introduce speedy trials for rape victims, in Gujarat, an alleged gang-rape survivor tried to commit suicide at court after the hearing in her case was adjourned to next month.

The woman drank poison at a city court in Ahmedabad and was rushed to hospital, where doctors say she is not in critical condition.

Her legal battle began in 2007. She alleges that she was raped in April 2007 by her employer and his friends at a garment factory, and that when she tried to file a police case in October that year, the police refused.  She then asked a court to intervene.

On various occasions, the police told the court that her allegations did not check out. In 2010, the court rejected the police's arguments and asked for a fresh inquiry along with all medical documents. Since then, there has been little progress in her case.

A three-member committee headed by Justice JS Verma today submitted its recommendations to the government on how to amend  sexual assault laws to protect women.  The committee was appointed by the government amid massive protests and public anger over the gang-rape of a medical student on a bus in Delhi.  She died in December from the monstrous injuries inflicted on her during her assault by six men.

Justice Verma called for speedy justice and the setting of a time frame to deal with cases of crimes against women.

New Delhi:
The head of a commission assigned to review laws for sexual crimes thanked the country's youth for fighting for change after a young student was gang-raped on a bus in Delhi last month. ""Young people are the real hope,"" said Justice JS Verma, ""they have taught the older generation."" (Highlights of Justice Verma's press conference)

Justice Verma, who retired as the chief justice of India, submitted his report to the government today and indicted the government and senior police officers for their response to the heinous attack on Amanat (NOT her real name).

""I was shocked that the Police Commissioner got a pat on the back by the Home Secretary. I was so shocked. The least I would have done was to seek an apology for the failure of my duty to protect citizens,"" said Justice Verma.

Days after the gang-rape, Home Secretary RK Singh had lauded the police for arresting six men who allegedly attacked the student.

Justice Verma said that ""the failure of good governance"" allows incidents like the heinous attack on the student, and is responsible for the palpable public anger that has followed. He said that the police proved its disinterest in reforms or change because the senior most officers from each state - Director Generals of Police (DGP) - did not respond to his committee's queries.

The three-member commission completed its review of existing laws and prepared its report within a tough 30-day deadline.

Justice Verma said he received 80,000 suggestions from India and abroad after he set January 5 as a deadline for receiving comments from the public. ""If we can do what we did in thirty days, then the government should be able to do the same with all its might and resources,"" he said, urging parliament to take up the report and its proposals urgently.

The three-member commission submitted its report to the government today. It was set up amid huge demonstrations by thousands of students who demanded tougher punishment for sexual offenders after the monstrous attack on Amanat (NOT her real name). She died two weeks after she was allegedly raped by six different men who also assaulted her boyfriend and her with an iron rod.

Justice Verma said he received 80,000 suggestions from India and abroad after he set January 5 as a deadline for comments from jurists, women's groups and other forums to revamp existing legislation to deal with sex offenders.

Congress party chief Sonia Gandhi on Sunday condemned the ""shameful"" social attitudes that she said led to crimes like gang-rape. The case had ""shaken the entire country"", she added.
India's 153-year-old penal code stipulates rapists should serve a minimum of seven years in prison and a maximum of life, while gang-rape convicts face a minimum term of 10 years and life imprisonment.

New Delhi:
The five men accused of raping and murdering a medical student on a bus in Delhi last month were brought to a special fast-track court today which will begin their trial on Thursday.

A lawyer for one of them says his client, Vinay Sharma, who worked at a gym as a fitness instructor, is under 18 and should be tried at a juvenile court. The police had said he is 20.

""My client is a minor and I have requested the court that his case should be moved to the juvenile justice court,"" Mr Sharma's lawyer AP Singh said to news agency AFP outside the courtroom, adding that a ruling was expected on Thursday, when the case will next be heard.

If convicted, the five men could face the death penalty. Their faces were covered by woollen scarves as they arrived in the court, surrounded by a ring of policemen.

In mid-December, they allegedly took a school bus out for a spin, pretending to be a charter bus that ferries passengers in Delhi, and attacked 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name) and her male friend with an iron rod after the couple bought tickets. They then allegedly took turns raping Amanat before throwing her with her friend onto the road. They wanted to run her over, the police has claimed, but her friend pushed her out of the way.

A sixth suspect in the crime which pierced India's conscience and provoked weeks of protests claims he is 17 and is being tried in a juvenile court, where the maximum sentence he faces is three years at a reform facility.

The judge of the fast-track court said today that the trial will be held in-camera or behind closed doors, with the media being told what parts of the proceedings can be reported. Defence lawyers wanted the proceedings to be held in an open court, but that motion was rejected by judge Yogesh Khanna partly to protect the identity of the student. (Read)

The judge told the lawyers to prepare for opening statements on Thursday. Once the trial begins, daily hearings are likely.

Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will hear a request by defence lawyers to move the trial outside Delhi because they claim the weight of public pressure in the capital is weighing heavily on the government and the judiciary.

New Delhi:
On a wintry evening in Delhi, beautician Geeta Misarvan leaves work, steeling herself for a long wait until a bus arrives, and with it the dreaded prospect of being groped by strangers during the ride home.

""Once a guy sees you travelling alone, he will come and stand right behind you. Then, he will lean in and press his body against yours and try to touch you,"" Misarvan said, describing an ordeal endured daily by many women in urban India.

In Delhi's crowded coaches, where men easily outnumber women, the sense of hostility and fear is particularly palpable in the wake of the widely-discussed gang-rape and murder of a young student on a moving bus in the city last month.

""It's terrifying,"" Misarvan told AFP. ""Sometimes I just lose it and ask the guy to stand properly but then he just yells at you, telling you to shut up.

""It's upsetting, but what more can I do? If the guy gets even more aggressive or violent, no one on that bus is going to help me... so I just put up with it and wait for my bus stop,"" she said.

Once 34-year-old Misarvan steps off the bus, she hunts for an auto-rickshaw, three-wheeled vehicles which are cheaper than taxis, since it's too dark and unsafe to make the 35-minute walk alone to her house.

On most evenings it takes her 90 minutes to arrive home from work.

India's expanding economy has seen unprecedented numbers of women join the workforce, but their emergence has been accompanied by growing threats to their security.

Like many working women, Poonam, a 21-year-old barista at an upmarket coffee shop in the capital, often stays late serving customers and says her parents fret nonstop about her comings and goings, calling her every night.

""I try to get an auto-rickshaw (home) because it's safer but the drivers haggle for double pay and I can't always afford it. So I end up waiting late at night for the bus, which never arrives on time,"" she told AFP.

Once on board, Poonam, who declined to give her surname, says that sexual harassment is a constant risk.

""There's nothing you can do about it, if you tell your family, chances are they will just tell you to stay home,"" she said.

India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said that economic progress is impossible without the ""active participation"" of women, but there are signs that the Delhi gang-rape case has led some to turn their backs on the workplace.

A survey by industry group ASSOCHAM published this month showed a 40 per cent fall in the productivity of female employees at call centres and IT firms in the country because many had reduced their hours or had quit their jobs.

Insensitive comments from politicians implying women are to blame for sexual assaults and clumsy ""safety tips"" from police have only fuelled anger among commuters.

A Delhi Police advisory posted on its official website suggests that women should ""turn off"" prospective attackers by vomiting or ""acting crazy"".

Just days after the December 16 gang-rape, KP Raghuvanshi, a senior police officer in Mumbai told female college students to carry a packet of chilli powder with them always and use it when threatened, the Press Trust of India reported.

While trains in Mumbai and Delhi run segregated women-only coaches in response to the high incidence of sexual harassment, many have now called for more vigilance by authorities and frequent police checks.

Police and prosecutors have outlined how the student and her male companion struggled to find transport to go home and so agreed to climb aboard the bus driven by the rapists.

The group allegedly beat up the man and repeatedly raped and assaulted the victim with a rusting metal bar in the back of the bus while driving around Delhi for some 45 minutes. Five adults were due to go on trial on Monday on charges of rape and murder in connection with the attack.

Since the attack, beautician Misarvan, who often boarded similar privately-run buses to visit her widowed mother in west Delhi, says she is too afraid to keep doing so and now spends more to take an auto-rickshaw instead.

Like her other female colleagues, she tries to leave work as early as possible and expresses no faith in the Indian police's ability to protect her.

""Nowhere in this country is safe,"" says the mother of two, the first woman in her family to have a job.

""I worry a lot about my daughter growing up here, whether she will have to endure the same problems, the same risks that I deal with every time I leave my house,"" she added.

New Delhi:
Lawyers for the five men accused of the gang-rape and murder of a medical student in Delhi last month want the trial to be moved out of Delhi for ""proper and justifiable hearing,"" and suggested Mathura and Coimbatore as options.

The five men are being represented by four different lawyers, who say that their clients are unlikely to get a fair trial at a fast track court that was set up earlier this month specifically for this case and others involving crimes against women.

ML Sharma, who is defending Mukesh, the man who was driving the bus that night, claims that humungous public pressure is driving the media, the government and the judiciary to indict his client.

The savage assault on Amanat (NOT her real name), who died, and her male friend, who survived, triggered a wave of angry protests across India with student demonstrators taking the lead.

After initially failing to gauge the public mood or assuage the overwhelming anger and grief, senior ministers including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh pledged that there would be swift and severe punishment for the guilty.

So far the trial proceeding has been held behind closed doors, partly because of the risk to the accused, a concern emphasised by not just their lawyers but the public prosecutors as well. Lawyers for the five men in jail claim that other prisoners had attacked them.

New Delhi:
Delhi witnessed a 23.43 per cent increase in rape cases inthe last one year, revealed figures released by the Delhi Police on Friday.While 572 rapes were reported in the national capital in 2011, the number roseto 706 in 2012.

New Delhi:
Despite elaborate steps by Delhi Police to ensure safety of women in the national capital, there is a sharp rise in the number of rape cases. Nearly 96 per cent of offenders are either related or known to victims, say police.

A total of 706 rape cases were reported in Delhi 2012 as compared to 572 in 2011. However, the incidence of rape per lakh population has shown a steady decline, coming down from 4.42 per lakh in 2005 to 4.15 per lakh in 2011.

Addressing the annual press conference of the Delhi Police, Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said that the brutal gang-rape of a 23-year-old paramedical student inside a moving bus in Delhi on December 16 was ""a turning point"" in rape cases.

Many elaborate steps have since been initiated by the force to ensure the safety of women.

""To reduce crime against women and make Delhi safer for women, we have taken elaborate measures. We have had a women's help desk that is now operational 24x7. When a woman complainant comes to a police station, jurisdiction will not be made an issue. Each deputy commissioner will go out for patrolling till midnight. We have introduced additional pickets. Each thana-level (police station) committee will be re-constituted to include women's NGOs. There will be zero tolerance for eve teasing,"" Mr Kumar asserted.

Delhi Police statistics showed that rape was usually committed by someone known to or related to the victim; 96 per cent of rape-accused are known to the victim, while only 3.68 per cent of rape accused are complete strangers, according to Delhi Police.

""Except for 26 cases reported in the year 2012, the accused were known to the victims in all other cases. This makes prevention of such crimes comparatively more difficult. These are opportunistic crimes, committed in private spaces,"" Mr Kumar said.

As far as molestation of women cases were concerned, in 2011, 727 such cases were reported. Of these, police claimed to have solved 94 per cent.

The police commissioner said there is a women's desk in each police station, and a helpline, at number 1091, dedicated to women.

NGOs working in women's empowerment are associated with each of the police stations.

""We have so far received 602 calls on the women's helpline,"" the Delhi Police commissioner said.

Jaipur:
Shaken by the brutal gangrape incident in Delhi, Congress president Sonia Gandhi today made a strong pitch for starting women empowerment from home.

""Mothers should teach their boys how to respect women in their family and in the neighbourhood. Women empowerment should start from home,"" she was quoted as having said at the party's Chintan Shivir in Jaipur.

She spent 30 minutes in the meeting of Congress group on women empowerment headed by MP Girija Vyas.

Earlier, in her opening remarks, Mrs Gandhi asked partymen to bring gender issues to ""the heart of our political activity"" saying the ""very disturbing trends"" against women and children should wake the party.

In her address, she described atrocities on women as a blot on conscience and a matter of shame, and stressed that gender issues should not just confined to Mahila Congress or women organisations only.

""I must say with the greatest anguish and pain that discrimination against the girl child continues. Atrocities on women, both in urban and rural India, are a blot on our collective conscience and a matter of great shame,"" Mrs Gandhi said.

""The way we still treat widows, the prevalence of female foeticide even in economically prosperous regions, the trafficking of children and women, brazen sexual harassment - these are all very disturbing trends that should shake and awaken us,"" she said.

""The entire party must understand them, and bring them to the heart of our political activity and change mindset,"" she added.

Kolkata:
Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad mentioned the name of the medical student who died after being brutally gang-raped by six men in Delhi while demanding death punishment for the perpetrators at a function in Kolkata today.

""I went to meet the family of the victim and the father related how the young girl was subjected to barbarism. He revealed his daughter's name to me,"" said Mr Prasad before mentioning the name of the victim to the audience.

""So long as a rape victim is alive you cannot mention her name, but in this case she is no more,"" added Mr Prasad while addressing an interactive programme on women's empowerment organised by the FICCI Ladies Organisation in Kolkata.

Union Law Minister Ashwani Kumar this month had said that the law was not in favour of revealing the identity of the woman.

Citing examples of Arab countries where criminals are stoned to death, Mr Prasad demanded the culprits should be hanged and called for stronger laws and stringent punishment for rape and other crimes against women.

""Our party has always been advocating for punishment for rapists and in the next session of parliament we will put pressure on the government to amend the respective laws and provide death for rape,"" he said.

""If Raavan can be killed for abducting Sita, then why can't these inhumans be hanged. Unless there are stringent punishments we cannot prevent crime against women,"" Mr Prasad said.

The 23-year-old trainee physiotherapist was brutally gang-raped by six men in a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16, sparking a nationwide protest over crime against women. She died on December 29 in a Singapore hospital where she was airlifted for specialised treatment.

Bhopal:
The outburst of emotions in the aftermath of the Delhi gang-rape case seems to have its desired effect on those responsible for law and order situation with the police in Madhya Pradesh's Jabalpur district filing a chargesheet in a rape case within 45 hours of the crime and that too against a powerful person.

""Sihora Police Station completed the investigations soon after filing of an FIR in the rape case involving a nine-year-old girl and filed the charge sheet within 45 hours of the heinous crime,"" Inspector General Jabalpur range, Madhu Kumar said.

""We have not just arrested the accused Congress corporator, Mohammad Gaus Azad on the charge of raping a minor but also collected credible evidence against him to ensure his conviction,"" the IG said.

""The case has been handed over to a Fast Track Court for trial and I am hopeful that the decision too would come soon in the matter, may be in a month or two"" he said.

Azad, a corporator from Sehora town, about 40 km away from Jabalpur district headquarter, had allegedly raped a nine-year-old girl after entering the house of the victim around 7.30 pm on January 13, taking advantage of the darkness as the power connection of the house was snapped due to non-payment of electricity bill, police sources said.

At the time of the incident, a lantern was lit in the house while the victim's father had gone to a nearby market while her brother was sleeping with her, police said.

Azad then allegedly raped the little girl and when she started crying in pain, he escaped from the spot threatening her with dire consequences if she revealed the incident to anyone, police said.

However, upon hearing the screams of the victim, neighbours reached the spot but Azad managed to escape after which the matter was reported to the police following which a case was registered under section 376(2)(f) (rape of girl under twelve years of age), 450 (criminal trespass) and other sections of the IPC, Sihora Police Station in-charge, Upendra Dixit said.

In swift action, police arrested Azad on January 14 as the girl recognised him as he was a well-known figure in the town and also she saw him in the light of a lantern.

After collecting credible evidence from the spot including injury marks on the girl's body caused by the accused, a lantern and other vital things besides the initial forensic report, the chargesheet was prepared and filed within 45 hours of the crime in the court, the police said.

The court has referred the matter to a Fast Track Court for speedy trial of the case.

However, taking into account the seriousness of the issue, Jabalpur District Congress (Rural) President, Rupendra Patel sacked Azad from the party.

New Delhi:
Ram Singh one of six men accused of raping and brutally murdering a 23-year-old medical student in a moving bus in Delhi last month, plans to petition the Supreme Court to move the trial out of Delhi.

Ram Singh was the driver of the bus in which the men inflicted the horrific assault on the young student and is the main accused. His lawyer, VK Anand, said today that he will move the Supreme Court to shift the case as he believes his client will not receive a fair trial in Delhi. Mr Anand alleges that the police is 'biased' against Ram Singh. Mr Anand has sought that the trial be moved to anywhere else in the country except Uttar Pradesh, where the girl came from.

ML Sharma, the lawyer of Ram Singh's brother, Mukesh, had earlier alleged that the accused were being physically tortured by the police in jail.

The defence lawyers, while scrutinising documents submitted by the Delhi Police along with its 650-page chargesheet, have also claimed that some crucial statements are illegible and have asked for new copies. The trial in a case that shook the nation's conscience, will be assigned to a fast-track court inaugurated earlier this month specially to hear this case and others involving crime against women.

One of the six men accused claims to be a minor and a Juvenile Justice Board will decide whether he is indeed a juvenile and so should be tried as such. The five other accused are being represented by a quartet of lawyers who have volunteered to handle their defence. Ram Singh is being represented by VK Anand, his brother, Mukesh, is being defended by ML Sharma. Another lawyer, AP Singh, will defend Akshay Singh, a bus cleaner and Vinay Sharma, who worked at a gym. Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller, is being defended by counsel Vivek Sharma.

The men are accused of gang-raping and brutally assaulting the medical student on December 16 last year and then throwing her out of the bus. The incident sparked outrage in the country and people took to the streets to demand the most stringent punishment for the accused. The young woman fought a valiant battle for her life in hospital for 13 days, but her injuries were too severe and she died in a Singapore hospital on December 29.

All the accused were arrested within days of the horrific assault.

New Delhi:
The school principal of the juvenile arrested in the gang-rape and murder case of a 23-year-old medical student today said he submitted before a Juvenile Justice Board that as per the school records the accused is 17 years and six months old. The juvenile is one of the six arrested men accused of raping and brutally assaulting the medical student, who died less than two weeks after the incident.

The former principal of the school in Badaun in Uttar Pradesh, where the juvenile had reportedly studied till Class III, appeared before the Board, presided over by Principal Magistrate Geetanjali Goel.

""We take this as the official record and later on follow the same throughout the academic session, so it could not be doubted,"" the principal told the media. However, the police says the school never asks the parents to give the child's birth certificate as age proof during the time of admission.

As per the school records, the juvenile accused was 17 years 6 months and 11 days old on the night of the incident. According to the police, the juvenile was one of the most savage attackers, but because of his age, he could be let off with a minimum punishment of three years of imprisonment, even after conviction.

However, if the Juvenile justice board is not satisfied with the school principal's statement and there is doubt about his date of birth, police will be able to conduct an ossification or a bone marrow test to determine his age. If the accused turns out to be an adult, then the police will file a supplementary chargesheet. But if the Juvenile Justice Board concludes that he is a minor then they will file an inquiry report, detailing his exact role in the brutal incident.

Taking note of the submissions made by the school principal, the court has now fixed January 28 as the next date of hearing in the case. The legal aid counsel for the juvenile, advocate Rajesh Tiwari, however, told the media outside the court that on the next date of hearing in the case the Board will hear arguments to decide the age of the juvenile and will thereafter give its verdict whether he is a major or minor.

The horrific incident took place on the night of December 16, 2012 when the 23-year-old medical student and her male friend boarded a private bus from Munirka in south Delhi after watching a movie in a mall. The six men on board brutally assaulted the couple and gang-raped the girl for forty minutes before throwing them out of the bus in a semi-naked state. After bravely fighting against the odds for 13 days, the girl succumbed to her injuries in a hospital in Singapore on December 29.

New Delhi:
Taking a strong stand against the statements made by some politicians over the gang-rape of a 23-year-old medical student in Delhi, Union Minister Jairam Ramesh said such people should be asked to ""go home"".

The minister said he felt ""diminished as a human being"" after the December incident which has hurt India's image across the world.

""None of us have come out of this looking good. Personally as a man, as an Indian, I felt demeaned by what happened. I felt diminished as a human being,"" he said.

Asked whether those who made insensitive statements should be punished or not, Mr Ramesh said, ""Privately I think anybody who makes such comments should be asked to go home. You make this comment with full knowledge. It is not that you have been misquoted... I find it appalling actually.""

Justifying the angry reaction from masses after the incident, he said the opportunity should be used to sensitise people and initiate political reforms in the country.

""There is anger against the political class and political process, which I think is perfectly justified... I would be the first to say that political class must look inwards. Why are we taking so much time on electoral reforms? Why are we giving tickets to criminals? Why are we giving tickets to people against whom rape charges have been framed,"" he said.

He said people are asking legitimate questions from the political parties. ""Why can't the political parties change their way of funding? The greatest source of black money in our country today is political financing. But there is no major reforms in this,"" he said.

Mr Ramesh suggested abolishing the MPLAD scheme and using the money to finance legitimate political activities.

""Ten years ago I had suggested that just abolish MPLADs and put that as state funding of elections. Today we are spending close to Rs 5000 crore a year on MPLADs,"" he said.

Mr Ramesh said all politicians should not be painted with the same brush.

""I don't think you can paint all politicians in all political parties with the same brush. There are black sheep, we have to isolate them. We must keep them aside, we must reform our political financing and electoral reforms,"" he added.

On typecasting Ministries such as Women and Child Development by putting them under women Ministers, Mr Ramesh said he will accept the portfolio if he gets the opportunity.

""Let me tell you if I am offered the Women and Child Development Ministry, I will gladly take it. I think it is a very important portfolio. I think this is typecasting and we have to get out of this typecasting,"" he said.

He also took a dig at religious leaders for making insensitive remarks.

""Look at some of the statements that have been made by so called religious personalities who appear on television giving solace to lakhs of Indian. If this is their mindset, then I am afraid we have a long way to go,"" he said.

Along with political and administrative reforms, the Minister also strongly advocated police reforms and making the force autonomous and professional.

Mr Ramesh, who also headed the Drinking Water and Sanitation Ministry till last Cabinet reshuffle, said one of the ways to ensure security and dignity for women is to ensure toilets for them.

""One of the most powerful thing any government can do is to take up the sanitation issue as a national obsession and make sure that all women have toilets, both in rural areas and urban areas,"" he said.

New Delhi:
The five men accused of raping and murdering a medical student on a bus in the capital last month were brought to a court in South Delhi today. They will be represented by a quartet of lawyers who volunteered to handle their defence.

ML Sharma, who is among the lawyers for the accused, alleged outside court that the men are being physically tortured by the police in jail. ""All the accused have been badly beaten by the police and they have used the third degree to extract the statement that suits the evidence they have collected,"" he said, adding that the accused ""have been forced to confess to crimes that they did not commit.""

The Saket Bar Association had said its members would not defend the men. The four advocates who have signed on will review the charges and evidence outlined against their clients by the Delhi Police.

At the next hearing on Monday, the trial is likely to be assigned to a fast-track court inaugurated earlier this month specially to hear this case and others involving crimes against women.

The woman who was raped was also hit with an iron rod along with a male friend after they boarded a bus last month. The couple was flung naked and battered onto the road about an hour later. The student died two weeks later.

The savagery of the assault singed India, provoking large demonstrations in Delhi and other cities, and forcing an urgent review of laws on sexual crimes.  

Ram Singh, the man who had access to the bus used for the heinous attack, will be represented by VK Anand.  His brother, Mukesh will be defended by ML Sharma. A lawyer named AP Singh will defend Akshay Singh, a bus cleaner and Vinay Sharma, who worked at a gym. Pawan Gupta, a fruit seller, will be defended by counsel Vivek Sharma.

New Delhi:
The five men accused of murdering and raping a medical student on a bus in Delhi have been brought from Tihar Jail to a South Delhi court today. The magistrate handling the pre-trial proceedings has banned the media from attending the hearings.

Concerns for their security were shared by the public prosecutor on Monday when they were brought to court for the first time after being charged with the crime that stunned and outraged India. Now, sources say options like holding their trial via video conference, or a trial within the premises of Tihar Jail are being considered.

That decision will be made by the judge of a fast-track court set up specially last week.  But before that, they need to get lawyers who will represent them in court and scrutinise the charges and evidence laid out against them in the chargesheet that has been submitted by the Delhi Police. If convicted, they could face the death penalty.

On Monday, the men were kept in a police cell at the court complex for hours while scenes of chaos and drama played out in the tiny packed court-room. The public prosecutor has said the security of the men is at risk.  When an advocate named ML Sharma volunteered to defend them, other lawyers shouted loudly against him. Magistrate Namrata Aggarwal ordered everyone not directly linked to the case to leave before the men were brought into her court.

A few days ago, a man was arrested for planting a bomb outside their homes in a slum in south Delhi.

Mr Sharma, who volunteered to defend the accused, will inform the judge today that Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh, and Akshay Thakur have signed him as their lawyer and plan to plead not guilty to all the charges against them.  For the other two men accused of rape and murder, the judge may appoint a lawyer.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court on Thursday hinted at speeding up of appeals pending in the court in cases of sexual harassment and crimes against women.

""Please wait for a week. I have something in mind. All matters like this one pending from 2004 and 2005 will be speeded up,"" said Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir when the All India Democratic Women's Association's appeal in the Suryanelli rape case came up.

V K Biju, lawyer for the association, said: ""The Chief Justice heard the appeal and said all such cases pending in the Supreme Court have to be fast-tracked.""

In the Suryanelli case, a 16-year-old girl was gang-raped by 42 men over 40 days in 1996.

The girl from Suryanelli in Idukki district of Kerala was abducted in January 1996 and moved from place to place across Kerala.

On September 6, 2000, a special court sentenced 36 persons to rigorous imprisonment for varying terms. But the Kerala High Court acquitted 35 convicts.

The court convicted one person and sentenced him to five years in jail and a fine of Rs 50,000.

Bhubaneswar:
Odisha has asked the police to file chargesheets in rape and other sexual offence cases related to women within 60 days of the crimes instead of 120 days stipulated in the law, an official said on Thursday.

The government will also set up special fast-track courts for speedy disposal of cases related to violence against women, a state home department official told IANS.

The decision was taken on Wednesday in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik at the state secretariat, he said.

In view of the public outrage over Delhi gang-rape in which a 23-year-old woman was also brutally assaulted in a moving bus and spurt in similar cases in the state, the government has also announced to take several other measures to prevent crimes against women, he said.

Victims of rape and other sexual violence would be allowed to lodge their complaints at any police station in the state. Such complaints would be immediately forwarded to the concerned police stations.

There is a provision of framing chargesheets within 120 days in the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code) but the government directed the police to complete probe into rapes, molestations and other crimes within 60 days.

Each police station will have at least one woman sub-inspector. Besides a separate cadre of public prosecutors will be created to handle cases related to crimes against women, he said.

The government's move comes hours after the opposition BJP demanded imposition of president's rule in the state to prevent rape cases and atrocities on women.

Citing government figures, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state unit vice president Ashok Sahu said Odisha had registered 1,112 rape cases in 2011, higher than the 1,025 cases reported in 2010. During 2012, rape incidents have reportedly increased to more than 1,300 cases.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court on Tuesday commuted the death sentence of a convict to life in a case of attempted rape and murder of a 17-year-old girl in Maharashtra. His accomplice in the crime is currently serving a life sentence.

The Supreme Court said the case does not fall under the category of 'rarest of rare' cases for the death penalty to be awarded. The court ruled that the convicted person will serve a life sentence.

The convict, Pathan, and his friend entered the girl's house to carry out a robbery. But when the girl tried to stop the accused, he tried to rape her and inflicted injuries all over her body, including her private parts, leading to the death of the girl

In August 2005, a trial court at Parbhani convicted Pathan and awarded him the death sentence.

The death sentence was upheld by the Bombay High Court in 2008.

Subsequently, an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court and Maharashtra government argued for the death sentence.

The defense lawyer had argued that the accused was an illiterate and his intention was only to rob and he committed the offense only when there was resistance.

New Delhi:
Today, the five men accused of murdering and raping a medical student on a bus in Delhi are meant to be brought from Tihar Jail to a South Delhi court.  

Concerns for their security were shared by the public prosecutor on Monday when they were brought to court for the first time after being charged with the crime that stunned and outraged India. Now, sources say options like holding their trial via video conference, or a trial within the premises of Tihar Jail are being considered.   

That decision will be made by the judge of a fast-track court set up specially last week.  But before that, they need to get lawyers who will represent them in court and scrutinise the charges and evidence laid out against them in the chargesheet that has been submitted by the Delhi Police.  If convicted, they could face the death penalty.

The magistrate handling the pre-trial proceedings has banned the media from attending the hearings.

On Monday, the men were kept in a police cell at the court complex for hours while scenes of chaos and drama played out in the tiny packed court-room. The public prosecutor has said the security of the men is at risk.  When an advocate named ML Sharma volunteered to defend them, other lawyers shouted loudly against him. Magistrate Namrata Aggarwal ordered everyone not directly linked to the case to leave before the men were brought into her court.

A few days ago, a man was arrested for planting a bomb outside their homes in a slum in south Delhi.

Mr Sharma, who volunteered to defend the accused, will inform the judge today that Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh, and Akshay Thakur have signed him as their lawyer and plan to plead not guilty to all the charges against them.  For the other two men accused of rape and murder, the judge may appoint a lawyer.

Protesters demand justice for Amanat.
New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court today asked the capital's police force why its top officer is not being held accountable for the barbarous gang-rape of a student on a moving bus in Delhi last month. She died nearly two weeks later; five men have been charged with her rape and murder.

The assault on 'Amanat' (NOT her real name) hit India with brute force, triggering massive angry protests and a demand for better policing in cities like Delhi. Amid the outpouring of anger and frustration, the Delhi High Court decided to seek a detailed explanation from the police of what happened that night as a school bus with tinted windows - a violation of the law - rolled through one police checkpost after another without being pulled over for inspection.

The court has repeatedly asked for details of the senior officers who were on duty that night.  Today, it asked, ""Why is only one ACP (Assistant Commissioner of Police) mentioned in the report? Why should there be no blame for the Deputy Commissioner of Police or the Commissioner?""

Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit is among those who has suggested that Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar must resign, accepting responsibility for the many lapses that allowed the assault on Amanat and her male friend after they boarded the bus. Six drunk men allegedly hit them with an iron rod before taking turns to rape her. The couple was then thrown naked onto the road.

Mr Kumar, the police commissioner, has refused to quit. The Delhi Police reports not to the chief minister, but the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, and is supervised by the union Home Ministry.

The government has set up a committee headed by retired High Court judge Usha Mehra to fix accountability for the attack on Amanat. Separately, the ministry has ordered an inquiry into allegations by Amanat's friend that when the couple was lying injured on the road, police officers who showed up wasted time arguing about jurisdiction and which hospital the couple should be moved to.

It has been directed that all such cases will be segregated ... and listed before the courts on priority basis,"" it read.

The move follows the gang-rape of a young woman in Delhi who died in Singapore after 13 days.

New Delhi:
A Delhi court has agreed that the media cannot attend the pre-trial hearings for the five men accused of raping and murdering a student on a moving Delhi bus. The judge handling the case currently will indicate what sections of the hearing can be reported.

The decision to hold in-camera proceedings was taken earlier this week by magistrate Namrita Aggarwal on the day when the men were first brought to court.  The public prosecutor has said that their safety is at risk. They were kept waiting in a police cell at the court complex for several hours; the tiny court-room, which can seat 30, was packed with more than 150 people till Ms Aggarwal ordered anyone not directly connected to the case to leave.

A group of lawyers had challenged her decision to ban the media from the court-room. Their appeal has been rejected today.

The next hearing in Judge Aggarwal's court is tomorrow. The case will eventually be tried by a fast-track court inaugurated last week specifically to expedite cases of crimes against women. The fast-track court's judge will decide if the trial there should also be held behind closed doors.

Three of the men accused of the crime that stunned India with its savagery have agreed to be represented by ML Sharma, an advocate who volunteered to defend them, provoking criticism from other advocates. The Saket Bar Association has refused to represent the accused.

Mr Sharma said that Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh, and Akshay Thakur will plead not guilty to all the charges against them.

On December 16, a physiotherapy student and her boyfriend boarded a bus at night after watching a movie at a South Delhi mall. The six men, who were already on the bus including the driver, were allegedly drunk. They had taken a school bus out for what the police described as ""a joyride."" They sexually harassed Amanat (NOT her real name) and then hit her boyfriend and her viciously with an iron rod. After that, they took turns raping her before throwing the couple onto the road. The police in its chargesheet against the five accused has said they also tried to drive over the couple, but Amanat's boyfriend, a software engineer, managed to push her out of the way.

The sixth man on the bus is a juvenile and will be tried separately. The Juvenile Justice Board earlier this week said it was not satisfied with school documents presented to bolster his claim that he is 17.

Former Supreme Court judge Justice AK Ganguly has criticised the delay in trials of rape cases and said the judiciary never treated women with dignity.

""The Constitution talks of equal status, equal opportunities. I want to say that we have never treated women with dignity,"" Justice Ganguly told NDTV.

He said that when it comes to safeguarding women, the judiciary is not following the Constitution; and the courts and judges needed to be sensitised.

""This is the mindset of most of us. We must face facts,"" he said.

Justice Ganguly said some rape cases have dragged on for 10-15 years and despite the Supreme Court's best efforts, these could not be disposed of quickly.

A 51-year-old doctor was arrested in New Delhi  for allegedly raping and threatening a woman in the national capital where three molestation cases were also reported in last 24 hours, police said.

Ashok Damir, a doctor who runs a clinic in central Delhi's Patel Nagar, was arrested after his employee of four years approached police alleging rape.

The 34-year-old victim alleged that she was being raped by the doctor for the past four years and he had threatened her with dire consequences if she divulged it to anybody.

She also alleged that Damir had extorted lakhs of rupees from her.

In another rape case reported last week, two cousins were arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a 21-year-old girl whom one of them was to marry. The arrested have been identified as Ajay and Deepak Gupta.

Meanwhile, police arrested a person, identified as Saurabh, for allegedly molesting a girl in Okhla in a mini- bus.

In Prasad Nagar, a 17-year-old student was molested on Monday allegedly by a driver who was stalking her for some time. A case of molestation was also reported from Madhu Vihar.

Mumbai:
The misogynistic rants from politicians about how women provoke rapes continue unabated.

Today, it was the turn of Samjawadi Party leader Abu Azmi to weigh in. He blamed fashion and nudity for provoking sexual violence, and  said that instead of ""modern women"" like actor-activist Shabana Azmi, the censor board for films should have rural women.  

He suggested laws be introduced to ""stop young boys and girls from roaming around in the night.""

Mr Azmi said that he supports Mohan Bhagwat, the leader of the right-wing RSS, who said earlier this week that rapes occur in westernized urban India, but not in rural ""Bharat"" where traditional values prevail.

After a young woman was gang-raped on a Delhi bus on December 16, an amalgamation of grief and anger has triggered a long-overdue discussion on the need for better protection for women, and more effective laws to punish sexual offenders.  

As the country does some soul searching on how it perceives and treats women, patriarchal and misogynistic comments from politicians and other leaders have exposed how much needs to change. A BJP minister in Chhatisgarh today said that crimes against women could be the result of a perverse alignment of the stars.  He said he doesn't have the answers, an astrologer may.  A few days ago, another minister from the BJP government in Madhya Pradesh warned that women must not cross the laxman-rekha and ""stay within their limits if they don't want to be attacked.""

Last month, President Pranab Mukherjee's son Abhijit, who is a parliamentarian, referred to women protestors in Delhi ""painted and dented.""

New Delhi:
The decision to fly the victim of a gang rape that outraged India for treatment in Singapore made little medical sense as the woman was so severely injured that her death was all but inevitable, doctors say.

The government, on the back foot after furious street protests and stinging criticism of authorities over the December 16 rape in the capital, New Delhi, has struggled to defend its decision to send the 23-year-old physiotherapy student overseas. She died 48 hours later.

With a deadly infection seeping into her blood from damage done to her intestines during the assault, complicated by a cardiac arrest and damage to the brain, she was just clinging to life when she was flown 4,000 km from New Delhi to Singapore late on December 26, doctors said.

""It was ethically and morally wrong to have taken her out, given that she was sinking and her chances of survival were next to zero at that stage,"" said a doctor at New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which was advising the team treating the woman at a sister hospital across the street.

""Such a thing raises false hopes in the minds of the family, the community. No doctor in his right mind would do this, unless you want to get the patient off your back,"" said the doctor, who declined to be identified, saying colleagues at the government-run hospital who had spoken out had been warned of consequences in what has become a politically explosive case.

The woman, who was assaulted by five men and a teenager on a moving bus after a male companion was beaten unconscious, cannot be named under a law that prohibits identifying victims of rape.

Another doctor who was consulted during the woman's care at New Delhi's Safdarjang hospital, where she was taken following the assault, said she had been getting the best possible treatment in India and the question of why she was shifted should be answered by the government.

Many security officials have said they feared the protests would escalate if the woman had died in New Delhi, but the government has said the only consideration was her wellbeing.

""The idea was to give her the best possible treatment,"" said Harish Rawat, a government minister who attended a cabinet meeting on the woman's condition and the efforts to save her.

""I don't think the idea was to run away from the problem. Death here or death abroad would still have the same impact,"" he said. ""We felt if there was a chance to save her, it should be tried. Take her to a transplant facility abroad.""

At the time of the transfer, authorities at Safdarjang said her condition was critical which was why they decided to move her to Singapore's Mount Elizabeth Hospital, which specialised in multi-organ transplant.

But a transplant for her damaged intestine, if at all possible, was months away, doctors said. At the time of her transfer, the woman, unconscious since a heart attack the previous night, was in no condition to go through such an operation.

""One cannot think about intestinal transplant at this moment,"" Samiran Nundy, the head of surgical gastroenterology and organ transplantation at the Ganga Ram Hospital in New Delhi, was quoted as saying in newspapers.

""First, the infection spreading in her should be stopped, then one can think about transplant.""

Within 40 hours of her arrival in Singapore, doctors called her family and told them the end was near, even as millions prayed at home in the hope that she would pull through.

""Sepsis followed by cardiac arrest is a terminal event in 99 percent of cases,"" said the doctor at AIIMS, referring to blood infection.

""Doctors will have anecdotal evidence about one or two cases in their whole career of somebody who survived. I had one case, a woman, but she too died within a month. Yes, miracles happen, but you were not looking at one in this case. It was clear to everyone, especially after the cardiac arrest.""

Protests and panic

Piecing together the events leading up to her death tells a tale of authorities in Delhi trying to defuse public anger over the attack by initially insisting that she was getting the best possible treatment, and then, as things began to go wrong, getting increasingly worried that the protests that tapped a deep vein of frustration, could spin out of control.

The alarm bells for the government rang late on Christmas night when the woman suffered the cardiac arrest. That was nine days after she was brought in to Safdarjang hospital in a life-threatening condition after the brutal assault - she was assessed then as 5 on a scale in which 6 is rated as no chance of survival.

After the heart attack, her pulse rate became critically low. Doctors resuscitated her after three to four minutes but by then she had become unconscious, caused by lack of blood to the brain. She never regained consciousness from that point on.

Equally worrisome, the infection from her injured intestines had seeped into her blood and was spreading to her vital organs.

For the government, shaken by the scale and intensity of the protests that focused on the lack of safety in the capital for women, the deterioration in her health was cause for concern.

Even as the union cabinet met the next morning, arrangements to fly the woman for treatment in Singapore were being put in place.

One official said the public mood was so fragile that the government felt that if she died in India, some people would have blamed the government for not sending her abroad for treatment.

""You can argue this the other way. They would have said 'if Sonia can go abroad, why not this girl',"" the official said, referring to the head of the ruling Congress party, Sonia Gandhi, who travels abroad for treatment of an undisclosed condition.

Outside the prime minister's office where the cabinet met, thousands of baton-wielding police including crack members of Rapid Action Force kept the area under a lockdown. Days earlier, pitched battles broke out between hundreds of protesters and police at the scene, in which a policeman was killed.

Protesters had climbed the walls of South and North Block, the high-security seat of government, while others swarmed towards the iron gates of the presidential palace. They carried placards such as ""The only two women safe in Delhi are Sonia Gandhi and Sheila Dikshit"". Mrs Dikshit is the chief minister, the top elected official of the local government of Delhi.

A government official privy to the handling of the protests said the administration had not anticipated that so many students would come out onto the streets and that the protests would last for so many days.

But when protesters showed up at the presidential palace, the line had been crossed in the security agencies' mind.

""It was a near-breach of security at the presidential palace. The officials tasked with security didn't know how to control the protesters, if they had jumped over its gates. Would you fire at the students, the housewives?"" the official asked.

The Intelligence Bureau, which coordinates all domestic intelligence, had been warning that the public mood may turn uglier, the official said.

No passports

At Safdarjung on the morning of December 26, a team of doctors arrived from Medanta Medicity, a private medical centre which runs an air ambulance service. Their mandate was to assess whether she could survive the airlift, said Dr Yatin Mehta, head of critical care at Medicity.

""The decision was to take her out of the country. Our job was to determine whether she could take the airlift, not whether she should be going or not,"" said Dr Mehta, who accompanied the woman on the flight.

He said the option of sending her to Cambridge in Britain to a hospital that specialises in transplants, was considered but dropped because it would have involved a refuelling stop for the aircraft and a two-hour road trip upon landing in London.

Flying her to the Canadian city of Toronto, which also has a specialised organ transplant centre, was also vetoed. They zeroed in on Singapore, six hours flying time away.

It is highly unusual for someone to be flown out of India for critical care. If anything, the traffic is the reverse, with people travelling to the country for treatment.

In the event, the transfer to Singapore was successful, Mehta said, although the woman suffered a drop in blood pressure during the flight. ""We were prepared for that. We handed her over to Mount E in the same condition she left the hospital in Delhi,"" he said, referring to the Singapore hospital.

The woman's family first got wind of the plan to transfer her at hospital in Delhi, when her brother noticed a flurry of activity and a staff member said that doctors were considering moving her.

""We accepted the decision. We were not interfering in the treatment. The doctors said it was in the best interest of our sister, we accepted it. Our only condition was to save her,"" the brother told Reuters.

Shortly afterwards, officials from the foreign ministry arrived and issued the family travel documents, since none of them had a passport. Their pictures were taken at the hospital.

Three ambulances arrived at the hospital. One of the ambulances headed into the interior of the city and another took the route to the Medanta centre, followed by a convoy of television crews.

A third, carrying the woman, sped away to a special section of Delhi airport, giving everyone the slip.

After she was taken to Singapore, authorities in the city-state's Mount Elizabeth Hospital were frank about her bleak chances for survival.

""The patient is currently struggling against the odds, and fighting for her life,"" Chief Executive Officer Kelvin Loh said in a statement a day after she was admitted.

""Our medical team's investigations upon her arrival at the hospital yesterday showed that in addition to her prior cardiac arrest, she also had infection of her lungs and abdomen as well as significant brain injury.""

Later that day, Mr Soh said her condition was deteriorating.

Her family was told the end was near.

""We didn't expect her to go so quickly,"" said her brother, who was with her when she died. ""At 9:30 p.m., the doctors called us in and said they were sorry, they couldn't do anything more. Her vital organs were failing.""

""We went inside and stayed with her the whole night. We saw her heart beat slowing down on the machine. It kept dropping and then dropped to zero. The time was 4:05 a.m.""

London:
As protests over the Delhi gang-rape simmer in India, the case has fired the imagination of the Indian diaspora in the UK. Members of the Indian community here are protesting almost on a daily basis, asking for change and standing in solidarity with 'Amanat' (NOT her real name) from thousands of miles away.

What started as small-scale prayer vigils are now taking the form of something much bigger. Hundreds of women and men of Indian origin and other Londoners turned up outside the Indian Embassy in London on Monday to show their support for India's Daughter. This was, by far, the loudest and biggest protest yet outside India.

A crowd of around four hundred protestors turned up, shouting slogans in support of the medical student - who was brutally gang-raped in Delhi on December 16, and succumbed to her injuries on December 29 in a Singapore hospital - and against the ""Indian state.""

They were joined by prominent persons of Indian-origin in the UK.

Gurinder Chadha, who has directed Bend it Like Beckham, among other movies, said, ""We're all Indians. This is a massive stain on us and no country can call itself civilised if it treats its women in this way. So, I am here as a vote to say- let's civilise ourselves. Let's be the great nation we want to be and that can only happen through respecting our women, daughters, sisters.""

Virendra Sharma, the Member of Parliament from Southall, was present as well.

""Twenty-first century generation is not going to accept this kind of behaviour and this kind of treatment of their partners. And that is why it is important that it is a place to raise this, we should do it. (sic)""

A local not-for-profit women's rights organisation, Southall Black Sisters, organised the protest. But many other groups and individuals decided to come and make themselves heard as well.

Steve Headley, a union leader, had a message for everyone in India. ""Well, from Britain, we would say that you are not unique in India. Sexual violence is a worldwide phenomenon. Governments all over the world and people must pressure governments to change the law and treat rape and sexual violence seriously and put an end to it all over the world.""

Many women in the crowd felt especially moved by this case and came with banners, loudspeakers, and candles.

""It is obviously a global issue, but now, this has become a focus. Gang-rape is very serious. Last night, another rape has happened. So, we have to come together to support this,"" said one of the protestors.

Another vigil is planned for India's Daughter on Sunday in a London suburb.

New Delhi:
After the national outpouring of sorrow and anger over the gang-rape and death of a young medical student in Delhi, the Chief Justice of India has written to all high courts, asking for fast-track courts to be established to expedite the cases of crimes against women.

The Chief Justice of India, Altamas Kabir, has asked high courts of all states to coordinate with state governments for the infrastructure needed to commission these special courts.

In his letter, Justice Kabir writes, ""The tragic incident involving the brutal gang rape and subsequent death of young physio-therapy student in Delhi on 16 December has engaged the attention of all and sundry in the national and international arena. The spontaneous outburst of outrage and anger is the measure of how the incident has let an indelible mark and shaken the conscience of the nation. Rape is not only physical barbarism but afflicts the very soul of a victim."" (Read the entire letter here)

Last week, Justice Kabir inaugurated a fast-track court in South Delhi's Saket district that will handle the trial of the five men accused of raping and killing the student. A sixth man arrested for the crime is a minor and will be tried separately by a court for juveniles.

At a meeting with Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde last week, representatives of all state governments asked the Centre to fund courts that will handle cases of crimes against women.

The notoriously slow legal system is seen as one of the reasons why sexual offenders remain largely unpunished in India.

Accused being brought to court in a police van
New Delhi:
A judge in Delhi has ruled that the media will not be allowed to attend the  trial of the  five men accused of raping and murdering a young medical student on a Delhi bus last month. The next hearing of the case has been set for Thursday.

The accused were brought to the court complex in the morning with heavy security cover and were kept in a prison cell within the court premises. At about 2 pm, the judge said there was no space for them to be brought into the court-room, which can seat about 30 but had more than 150 people crammed in, many of them lawyers and reporters.

""It has become impossible for this court to conduct proceedings in this case,"" magistrate Namrita Aggarwal said, ordering anyone not directly connected to the case to exit.

The men, who could face the death penalty if convicted, arrived after that in the court-room. They were given copies of the police's chargesheet. After a decision has been made on who will represent them, the case will be assigned to a fast-track court set up last week specially to handle this trial and expedite other cases of crimes against women.

Throughout the day, the proceedings were punctuated by lawyers shouting against an advocate who has volunteered to defend the accused. The Saket Bar Association had said none of its members would defend the men accused of the crime that united India in anger and grief, corroborated by large protests in cities like Delhi.

ML Sharma said the families of the accused had approached him to defend them. Other advocates dismissed him as a publicity-seeker.

The police has said it has forensic evidence to establish the guilt of the defendants. A sixth man who was on the bus, who is 17, is to be tried in a separate court for juveniles. The police says he was the most depraved of the group.

On December 16, the student and her boyfriend watched a movie at a South Delhi mall. They then boarded a school bus that was running illegally at night. The driver, according to the police, had decided to go for ""a joyride"" with his friends. The couple were led to believe the school bus was a private or chartered bus, hundreds of which operate in Delhi to compensate for thin public transport.

Once they boarded the bus, the six men allegedly hit them with an iron rod before taking turns to rape the young woman. The pair were then thrown out of the moving vehicle.

New Delhi:
The five men charged with the brutal gang-rape and murder of a student on a bus in Delhi were brought to court for the first time this morning after the police said forensic evidence links them to the heinous crime.

The sixth man who was on the bus, is a minor, and unless proven otherwise, he will be tried by a separate court for juveniles. A school certificate provided by him states he's 17. The maximum sentence a juvenile court can give to a minor is three years at a reform facility.

Last month, a 23-year-old student and her boyfriend were beaten with an iron rod, allegedly by the six men who have since been arrested for a crime that led to national protests and outrage. The couple was attacked after they boarded a bus. Amanat (NOT her real name) was then raped by the men after which the couple was thrown onto the road, battered and naked.

The principal of the minor's school will appear this afternoon before the Juvenile Justice Board. He is likely to be asked about the authenticity of the documents furnished by the minor to bolster his claim about his age.

Sources in the police say that of the six men who attacked the couple with unmitigated cruelty, the minor was the most vicious. They say he raped the student twice - once when she was unconscious.

According to the law, if school documents that establish a minor's age appear genuine, the juvenile should not be put through a medical test to confirm his age. The Delhi Police is reportedly keen for the minor to be put through a bone test to check his age.

Accused being brought to court in a police van
New Delhi:
The judge in a South Delhi court has ordered an 'in-camera' trial for the five men accused of raping and murdering a physiotherapy student on a bus in Delhi. A trial 'in-camera' means it is not open to members of the public and the press cannot report on proceedings in court.

There was drama in the court today after the men were brought to the court complex in Saket in a large police van. Till 2 pm, they had not been brought into the court-room. Proceedings are now expected to start at 2:45 pm after the judge agreed to the public prosecutor's request for an in-camera trial. The public prosecutor had cited a ""threat to the under-trials.""

The proceedings till then were marred by chaos as lawyers sporadically shouted against an advocate who has volunteered to defend the accused, describing him as a publicity seeker.  The Saket Bar Association had said none of its members would defend the man accused of the crime that united India in anger and grief, corroborated by large protests in cities like Delhi. 

ML Sharma, a lawyer, said the families of the accused men had approached him to defend them. The judge today said  he would not be allowed to meet the accused on the court premises and could go to Tihar Jail to sign the 'vakalatnama' (contract with the lawyer)

The accused are expected be given copies of the chargesheet. Once the defence counsel has been appointed and he goes through the charges, the case can then be shifted to a special fast-track court, that is expected to hold daily hearings.

The police has said it has forensic evidence to establish their guilt. The defendants could face the death penalty if convicted.

A sixth man who was on the bus, who is 17, is to be tried in a separate court for juveniles. The police says he was the most depraved of the group.

Police have pledged 'maximum security' during the hearing at the court amid fears for the defendants' safety. A man was arrested last week as he allegedly tried to plant a crude bomb near the home of one of the men.

On December 16, the student and her boyfriend watched a movie at a South Delhi mall. They then boarded a school bus that was running illegally at night. The driver, according to the police, had decided to go for ""a joyride"" with his friends. The couple were led to believe the school bus was a private or chartered bus, hundreds of which operate in Delhi to compensate for thin public transport.

Once they boarded the bus, the six men allegedly hit them with an iron rod before taking turns to rape the young woman.  The pair were then thrown out of the moving vehicle.

""The blood of the victim tallied with the stains found on the clothes of the accused,"" said Rajiv Mohan, part of the prosecution team, said on Saturday in court.

New Delhi:
Five men charged with last month's rape and murder of a 23-year-old medical student in Delhi will be produced before a court in the Capital on Monday.

Ram Singh, Mukesh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur are expected to be brought to the Saket court a little past noon. The court has taken cognisance of the charges against them and issued production warrants.

The sixth accused in the case is 17 years old, according to a school document, and has been kept at a juvenile home since his arrest. The Juvenile Justice Board has summoned the principal of the school where the juvenile studied up to class 7, in a village in Uttar Pradesh. The police are investigating the authenticity of the certificate from the school which says the juvenile was a little over 17 years of age on the date of the incident. (Arrested juvenile must be tried as an adult: lawyer)

Police sources say the sixth accused was the most barbaric during the attack on the student in a moving bus on the night of December 16. A close associate of the family of the student's male friend, who accompanied her in the bus, has said he will file a petition seeking that the juvenile be tried as an adult. (Juvenile raped 'Amanat' twice, once while she was unconscious: police sources)

In addition to rape and murder, the police have charged the five men with destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy. Results of DNA tests conducted on the men, aged 19 to 35, allegedly link them to the crime. If convicted, they could face death penalty. (DNA tests establish guilt, says prosecution)

""We have filed all the evidence. The blood of the student tallied with the stains found on the clothes of the accused,"" said Rajiv Mohan, public prosecutor. He has asked for a closed trial and requested that the court protect the identity and privacy of the student and her family.

The evidence presented by the police will include the testimony recorded by the student while she was critical in hospital, and the account of her male friend. The two had boarded the bus after watching The Life of Pi at a south Delhi mall.

The six men, allegedly drunk, began assaulting them with an iron rod before they gang-raped the student. An hour later, they threw the couple onto the road. The police says that the man driving the bus tried to run the student over, but her friend managed to save her just in time. The student died on December 29 in a Singapore hospital.

The attack wounded and shamed India, triggering a public demand for tough rape laws, better police protection for women and faster trials for cases of sexual assault. (Sign petition here for women's safety)

A series of missteps by the government in its handling of public sorrow and rage over the student's case deepened the perception that it is estranged from the people. A committee of legal experts, headed by retired Supreme Court judge JS Verma, is reviewing criminal laws and will suggest what changes can or should be made for laws that handle sexual assault crimes. The team will submit its report within a month.

New Delhi:
The father of the 23-year-old medical student, who died after being brutally gang-raped in Delhi, has said he wants his daughter's name revealed, saying it only will give courage to other women.

In an interview to British publication 'The Sunday People', he said: ""We want the world to know her real name. My daughter didn't do anything wrong, she died while protecting herself.""

As per law, the identity of victims of sexual assault cannot be revealed. Delhi Police refused to comment on the interview.

The woman was gang-raped and tortured in a moving bus on December 16 last year. She died in a Singapore hospital 13 days later.

The incident fuelled widespread protests in India, with demonstrators and security forces clashing in Delhi.

""I am proud of her. Revealing her name will give courage to other women who have survived these attacks. They will find strength from my daughter,"" her father was quoted as saying.

Chicago:
Indian-Americans in Chicago, led by students of two leading universities, held a protest meet and candlelight vigil in memory of the Delhi student 'Amanat' (NOT her real name) and sought change in India's rape laws and strict conviction of the accused to help reduce crime against women.

Indian students pursuing graduate studies at the University of Chicago and Northwestern University organised the meet on Friday to condemn the brutal gang-rape of the 23-year-old physiotherapy student who died in a Singapore hospital after battling for life for almost two weeks.

The students discussed policy recommendations that can be implemented to reduce crime against women.

They held placards that read 'No committees, we demand speedy justice', 'This world also belongs to women, respect them' and 'Say no to politicians with rape charges' as they demanded ""speedy justice"" and ""strict conviction"" of those accused of committing crimes against women.

Among the recommendations made by the students was broadening the definition of rape in Indian laws to include sexual abuse after marriage.

""Incumbent rape laws that include archaic and often imprecise language such as 'outraging the modesty of women' need to change. All forms of sexual assault, including marital rape must be punishable by law,"" Aman Chitkara, a public policy student at the University of Chicago, said.

The students also demanded speedy passage of the women's reservation bill in the Indian parliament.

The group suggested that professional counselling centres should be set up for rape victims and their families to help them return to normalcy.

""We need to help more and more rape victims to resume normal lives, as this will reduce the perception of rape as an act of subjugation. Consequently its incidence will go down,"" an organizer of the meet Harsh Taneja said.

Subramanian, a PhD candidate at Northwestern University, said efforts should be made to improve the lives of Dalit women in villages, where physical and sexual oppression are regarded as ""ordinary aspects"" of daily life and not reported as a crime.

The students held a candlelight vigil to pay homage to the Delhi rape victim.

The brother of the 23-year-old medical student, who was brutally grangraped by six men in a moving bus in Delhi on December 16, today said delay in providing medical assistance to his sister led to complications which perhaps led to her death.

""She told me that after the incident that she had asked passers-by for help but to no avail and it was only after the highway patrol alerted the police that she was rushed to hospital but it had taken almost two hours"", her brother told PTI.

""By then a lot of blood was lost"", he said, adding that ""had the passers-by helped and if prompt medical assistance was provided, perhaps her life could have been saved.

He said people need to change their attitude and be ready to extend help.

Regretting that consensus could not be reached in the meeting between representatives of the central and state governments on capital punishment in rape cases, he said the family has confidence that on the basis of the chargesheet filed by the Delhi Police in his sister's case, all the accused would be sentenced to death.

Speaking about his sister, he said she had keen interest in films and was an Aamir Khan fan. 'Talash' was the last film that she had seen with her brothers, he said.

A Delhi court has taken cognisance of the charges against the five men accused of the murder and rape of a 23-year-old medical student in the national capital, whose assault and death united the country in sorrow, anger and a determination to press for stronger laws to protect women.

The court has also issued production warrants to all the accused - Ram Singh, Mukesh, Pawan Gupta, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Thakur - to appear before it on Monday at 12:30 pm. The next date of hearing has been fixed on January 10 at the Saket court.

The sixth accused in the case is 17 years old, according to a school document, and has been kept at a juvenile home since he was arrested. His matter will be taken up by the Juvenile Justice Board on Monday. (Arrested juvenile must be tried as an adult: lawyer)

Police sources say this particular accused committed some of the most barbaric acts.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court has refused a request to disqualify legislators facing charges of sexual assault. However, the court has asked all states and the union government to explain within four weeks whether they plan set up fast-track courts to handle rape cases.

The judges have asked for states and the Centre to explain if and when these special courts will have judges, how they will be selected, and what will be done to compensate rape victims.

Today's directives are based on a petition filed by former IAS officer Promilla Shanker which asked the Supreme Court to suspend all lawmakers from national and state legislatures who face prosecution for crimes against women.

""We can't disqualify MPs and MLAs. We don't have this power. Such a sweeping relief can't be sought,"" the judges said today.

The gang-rape and killing of a student in the capital two weeks ago has triggered a national debate on the safety of women and whether those accused of crimes against women are allowed to escape penalties.

New Delhi:
Five men have been charged with murdering and raping a young physiotherapy student on a bus in Delhi last month. The evidence submitted by the Delhi Police against them in court yesterday as part of its chargesheet includes the results of DNA tests that link the men to the crime that has led to a national cry for change.

A sixth man who was on the bus and has been arrested is in a juvenile home because he is allegedly 17 years old. A bone test will determine if that's correct. But sources in the police say that of the group that was drunk and relentless in attacking the girl and her male friend, he was the most depraved, raping the student twice - once when she was unconscious - and suggesting that she be thrown from the bus after each of the men had sexually assaulted her.

Unless a bone density test proves the teen has lied about his age, his case will be handled at a juvenile court where the maximum sentence would be three years in a reform facility.

Amanat (NOT her real name) and her male friend boarded a bus with tinted windows and curtains after watching a film on a Sunday night. The teenager called out to them as they stood at a bus stop, asking them where they wanted to go.  He said the bus was headed in the same direction.  When the couple boarded, the six men on the bus harassed the girl, asking why she was out at night with a man.  When Amanat's friend tried to intervene, the men used an iron rod to batter him. They used the same iron rod on her when she tried to protect him.  So barbarous was their attack that her intestines were severely damaged.  That is one of the reasons why she would be flown to a hospital in Singapore known for its expertise in organ transplant.  She died there on December 29.

An hour after the couple boarded, they were thrown from the bus.  The attackers allegedly thought Amanat was dead. ""Ladki mar gayi (the girl has died),"" they said, according to what the young software engineer who was with Amanat has told the police.

New Delhi:
After five men were charged with kidnapping, rape and murder of the 23-year-old medical student in a Delhi bus last month, public prosecutor Rajiv Mohan today said that the DNA test established their guilt.

The DNA test and other documents were handed over by the police in a sealed cover to a south Delhi court today where Mr Mohan asked that the identity of the student and her family be protected.

On December 16, Amanat (NOT her real name), was travelling with her male friend on a bus. The six men on board hit the couple relentlessly with an iron rod and took turns raping her. They then pushed the student and her friend on to the road. She died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital.

The five men were not brought to the court today.

""We have invoked section 120-B as all the six accused have committed the crime in a well-planned manner. Each one of them has a specific role in the commission of the offence. So they are equally liable for the crime. We have sufficient evidence against all the accused including the juvenile offender,"" Mr Mohan told reporters.

New Delhi:
Rape, murder and destruction of evidence were among the charges filed today in a South Delhi court against five men accused of  raping a young woman on a bus in Delhi last month, and hitting her boyfriend and her with a metal rod, before discarding them on the road.

Public Prosecutor Rajiv Mohan requested the court that the trial be held in-camera and that the identity of the student and her family be protected.

Some documents were handed over by the police in a sealed cover - sources described these as ""sensitive documents"" including DNA and forensic reports that link the five arrested men to the crime. (Read) A sixth, who claims he is 17, is in a juvenile home and is likely to be tried separately unless medical tests confirm he is 18 or older.

The depravity of the assault, the woman's courageous fight for her life in hospital,  and her death provoked huge protests in Delhi and other cities, with students and others demanding better safety for women and stricter anti-rape laws. (Sign petition for women's safety)

Lawyers at the district court in New Delhi have decided they will not defend the suspects, meaning the government will have to appoint advocates for them.

The men charged are Ram Singh, 33, the bus driver; his brother Mukesh Singh, 26, who cleans buses for the same company; Pavan Gupta, 19, a fruit vendor; Akshay Singh, 24, a bus washer; and Vinay Sharma, 20, a fitness trainer. They did not appear in court.

Indian Chief Justice Altamas Kabir said the accused should be tried swiftly, but cautioned that they needed to be given a fair trial and not be subjected to mob justice.

""Let us not lose sight of the fact that a person is presumed innocent until proven guilty,"" he told reporters on Wednesday, while inaugurating the new fast-track court. ""Let us balance things. Let us not get carried away. Provide justice in a fair but swift manner so that faith of people is once again restored that the judiciary is there behind the common man.

New Delhi:
The Delhi Police  have formally charged five men with  the murder and  rape of a young medical student in Delhi, whose assault and death united the country in sorrow, anger and a determination to press for stronger laws to protect women.

Public Prosecutor Rajiv Mohan has asked for a closed trial and requested that the court protect the identity and privacy of the student and her family. (Read)

Results of DNA tests conducted on the five men, aged 19 to 35, allegedly link them to the crime. They were not in court today. In addition to rape and murder, they have been charged with destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy. If convicted, they could face the death penalty. (DNA tests establish guilt, says prosecution)

A sixth man on the bus who has been arrested claims he is 17; unless a bone test proves otherwise, his case will be handled at a juvenile court where the maximum sentence would be three years in a reform facility. (Arrested juvenile must be tried as an adult: lawyer)

The police has said it will work overtime to ensure its case is water-tight; the government has asseverated  that a swift trial will be conducted to provide the harshest punishment to the guilty. But today there was some floundering.  

The police showed up late at a district court in Saket in South Delhi. By  that time, the Metropolitan Magistrate had left, which meant that the case could not be transferred to the fast-track court inaugurated yesterday specifically to handle crimes against women.

So the 35-page chargesheet with hundreds of pages of supporting documents  will be filed now before the magistrate on Saturday, who will then assign the case to the fast-track court, though the judge who will try the case has yet to be selected.

The police blamed its late entry on unexpected delays in uploading documents onto a pen drive, which is likely to be submitted to court on Saturday.

The evidence presented by the police will include testimony recorded by the student while she was critical in hospital, and the account of her male friend who was with her on the bus they boarded after watching The Life of Pi at a South Delhi mall.

Six men, allegedly drunk, then began assaulting them with an iron rod before they gang-raped the student. An hour later, they threw the couple onto the road.  The police says that the man driving the bus tried to run Amanat over, but her friend managed to push her out of the way. He has reportedly recovered from his injuries and is helping the investigation.

The attack wounded and shamed India, triggering public demand for tough new rape laws, better police protection for women and faster trials for cases of sexual assault. Students have led near-daily protests in Delhi. (Sign petition here for women's safety)

A series of missteps by the government in its handling of public sorrow and rage over the student's case deepened the perception that it is estranged from the people. A committee of legal experts, headed by retired Supreme Court judge JS Verma, is reviewing criminal laws and will suggest what changes can or should be made for laws that handle sexual assault crimes. The team will submit its report within a month.

New Delhi:
The Delhi Police have formally charged five men with the murder and rape of a young medical student in Delhi, whose assault and death two weeks later united the country in sorrow, anger and a determination to press for stronger laws to protect women.
Here are the latest developments in this story:
The Delhi Police filed its charges in  a court in Saket.But because the police was late, the charge-sheet could not be given to a magistrate who is authorized to transfer the case to the fast-track court that is meant to hold daily hearings on this case.  That process will now be handled on Saturday.  
Six men have been arrested for gang-raping 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name)  and hitting her male friend and her with an iron rod on a moving bus in Delhi.  Charges against five of them include murder, gangrape, kidnapping, unnatural offences, dacoity, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy
The sixth man on the bus claims he is 17; unless a bone test proves otherwise, his case will be handled at a juvenile court where the maximum sentence would be three years in a reform facility.  A lawyer who is close to the family of the student says he will ask for the juvenile to be tried as an adult. ""Before he comes to know of his fundamental rights he should learn about his fundamental duties,"" said DK Mishra.
For the five adults, the police will seek the death penalty.
Large parts of the trial are expected to be conducted in camera to protect the privacy of the student and her family.  
The Saket Bar Association has said its lawyers will not defend the suspects because of the nature of the crime, but the court is expected to appoint attorneys to defend them.
The evidence presented by the police will be testimony recorded by the student while she was critical in hospital, and the account of her male friend who was with her on the bus they boarded after watching The Life of Pi at a South Delhi mall
The attack wounded and shamed India, triggering public demand for tough new rape laws, better police protection for women and faster trials for cases of sexual assault. Students have led near-daily protests in Delhi.
After throwing her from the private bus, the driver tried to run the victim over but she was pulled away by her companion, police sources said.
A series of missteps by the government in its handling of public sorrow and rage over the student's case deepened the perception that it is estranged from the people. A committee of legal experts, headed by retired Supreme Court judge JS Verma, is reviewing criminal laws and will suggest what changes can or should be made for sexual assault cases.

New Delhi:
The Delhi Police today filed charges of rape, murder, and destruction of evidence against five men accused of the gang-rape a 23-year-old student on a Delhi bus on December 16.

The sixth, who claims he is 17 years old, is in a juvenile home. Bone density tests will determine his age.

The student and her male friend had boarded a bus after watching a movie when the six men attacked them with an iron rod. They then sexually assaulted the girl before throwing the couple onto the road.

A lawyer close to the family of the student's friend - who has reportedly recovered from his injuries - says he will appeal for the juvenile to be tried as an adult.

""Before he comes to know of his fundamental rights he should learn about his fundamental duties,"" the lawyer, DK Mishra said.

A fast-track court was inaugurated yesterday by the Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir. The judge will hold daily hearings in the case; the trial is largely expected to be held in-camera to protect the family and the student who died.

Thousands of Indians have lit candles, held prayer meetings and marched through various cities and towns to express their grief and demand stronger protection for women and the death penalty for rape, which is now punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment.

Chandigarh:
Amid nationwide furor over the gang-rape and murder of a paramedic student in Delhi, five fresh cases of crime against women were reported on Wednesday in neighbouring Punjab, prompting the state police to constitute specialised investigation teams.

A six-year-old girl from Singhpura Munnan village in Moga district was raped, Senior SP (Moga) S S Grewal said.

The accused Soni Singh took the victim to his place about 20 days back and raped her, Grewal said, adding that Singh had confessed to the crime about which police came to know only on Monday.

The accused has been arrested, the SSP said. Medical examination of the girl confirmed rape.

In a separate case, an eight-year-old girl of a migrant labourer was allegedly raped and killed by a 25-year-old youth at Simbli village in Hoshiarpur district.

Mehtiana police booked a youth, Sanjay Kumar, of district Purnia (Bihar). The accused is at large.

Both, Kumar and the victim's family, were living at a farmhouse in Simbli village.

On Wednesday, the girl's body was found in nearby fields.

In the third incident, a 14-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped by three persons at Talwandi Kalan village on the outskirts of Ludhiana city.

Police Commissioner Ishwar Singh said that all the accused, aged between 28 to 30 have been arrested.

In reply to a question, the Commissioner said that investigations and medical check-up of the victim have been carried under the supervision of a lady IPS officer Jagdambey Nilambri.

In another crime against women, three villagers were on Wednesday booked on the charge of teasing and beating up a woman of the same village.

The accused Ladoo, Sonu and Kaka, all residents of Bassi Mustafa village were booked.

The girl alleged in her complaint that while she along with her sister was returning home from work, the accused first teased her and then later thrashed her up.

In another case, police on Tuesday booked ten persons in connection with the alleged abduction of two sisters at Jalala village of Hoshiarpur district.

The accused went to the victim's home on the night of December 29 and allegedly kidnapped them, police said.

The Punjab Police has decided to constitute specialised investigation teams to deal with sexual assaults on women, official sources said in Chandigarh.

The Sexual Assault Response Teams will comprise women in combat wing and men in the administrative roles. Rape cases will be reported to the headquarters on the same day and women constables will record statements of victims.

Meanwhile, a 20-year-old woman from Karnal, who had accused her neighbour Pardeep of raping her since June last year, died at a hospital at Rohtak on December 29 after delivering a still born child, police said. Pardeep has been arrested on charges of rape.

The victim died after developing post-delivery complications, police said. The DNA sample of the stillborn child will now be matched with the DNA of the accused.

New Delhi:
This morning, the family of the medical student who died after being gang-raped by six men on a moving bus in Delhi said that they would like for new laws being framed on rape to be named after her.

""If the government names the revised anti-rape law after her, we have no objection and it would be an honour to her,"" said her brother and father.

However, sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs say that there are no provisions to name a section of criminal laws for somebody.

The attack on the student - and her brave fight to stay alive for 13 days - has stunned, shamed and provoked India into demanding better safety for women and tougher and more effective laws to punish crimes of sexual assault.

Confronted by unwavering public outrage, the government has set up a commission to study how to amend criminal laws to provide enhanced punishment for sexual offenders. The committee, headed by Justice JS Verma, has received 18,000 suggestions on email from the public. Leaders of political parties have also been requested by the government to send their comments to the same committee, which will submit its report in a month.

The government says the report will then be discussed in detail in Parliament.

New Delhi:
A fast-track court in Saket, that will hear the gang-rape and murder case of the 23-year-old medical student in a day-to-day trial, will be inaugurated at 5:30 pm today by the Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir.

'Amanat' (NOT her real name) was raped and brutally assaulted with an iron rod on December 16 in a moving bus in south Delhi by six drunk men. She died on Saturday in a Singapore hospital, where she was shifted to last week. All six accused have been arrested.

After raping her, they stripped the 23-year-old and her friend, also badly beaten, and threw them out of the bus. They also allegedly tried to drive the bus over the couple. The friend pulled her to safety, just in time, police sources say. This is one of many shocking details now emerging of what happened on the evening of Sunday, December 16, as the Delhi Police puts together a 1000-page chargesheet which it plans to submit in a Delhi court on tomorrow. (Read)

The sources said the police chargesheet is likely to give details of the horrific brutality of the six men and the valiant attempt of the young woman and her friend, hopelessly outnumbered, to fight them off. In that effort, as she was pinned down and raped, the young woman bit three of the men assaulting her. The bite marks on the three accused men are likely to be part of the Delhi Police's evidence, the sources say.

After the police submit their chargesheet in the magistrate court in Saket on Thursday, the case will be moved to the fast-track court.

Over 2,500 advocates registered at the court have decided to ""stay away"" to ensure ""speedy justice"", meaning the government would have to appoint lawyers for the defendants. ""We have decided that no lawyer will stand up to defend the rape accused as it would be immoral to defend the case,"" Sanjay Kumar, a lawyer and a member of the Saket District Bar Council, told AFP. (Read: Lawyers refuse to defend men on trial in 'Amanat' case)

The Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court had said last month that all cases related to crimes against women in the city would be handled by the fast-track courts. The other Fast-track courts will function at Dwarka, Rohini and Tis Hazari. All these courts will start functioning from January 3.

The unabated monstrosity of the attack on 'Amanat' has walloped India, stirring anger and protests, with thousands pledging to fight in her memory for better safety for women and tougher laws for those convicted of rape. Activists have pointed out the need for fast-track trials for rape cases to counter the perception that the notoriously slow legal system allows those accused of sexual and other crimes to escape punishment.

Kottayam:
Terming the Delhi gang-rape case as a ""horrendous incident"", Defence Minister AK Antony on Wednesday said the Centre would bring out a law that ensures stringent punishment for culprits involved in crimes against women as soon as it gets the Justice J S Verma Committee report.

""What has happened in Delhi is brutal. The accused should get harshest punishment. This is my view and demand of the public as a whole,"" Mr Antony said.

""Let the protests and reactions of society against the Delhi incident open our eyes. I don't think the public outcry would subside soon,"" he said while inaugurating the 136th birth anniversary celebrations of Mannath Padmanabhan, social reformer and founder of Nair Service Society at Perunna near
Kottayam.

Asserting that the Centre would implement the recommendations of the Verma Committee as soon as it gets the report, he said law, court and police alone were not enough. However, a social movement was needed to prevent crimes against women.

The government had on December 23 constituted the Committee under the chairmanship of Justice (retd) Verma, former Chief Justice of India, to look into the possible amendments of the criminal law so as to provide for quicker trial and enhanced punishment to criminals in such cases.

""It is the duty of every citizen, both men and women, to create an atmosphere where women are totally safe at home, schools, public places and work places,"" Mr Antony said.

""Ensuring safety of women not only requires legislative measures but a strong social movement. This has already started in India. Not only political parties but social organisations and NGOs have also a vital role to play in this movement to cleanse the society from the impurities that have accumulated and tainting it,"" he said.

Lauding the role of Mannath Padmanabhan in reforming the caste-ridden Kerala society in the last century, Mr Antony said it was unfortunate that communal mistrust was becoming a cause for concern in the state again.
 
If this was allowed to grow unchecked, Kerala would again become a ""lunatic asylum"" of rigid casteism as said by Swami Vivekananda over a century back, he added.

New Delhi:
The Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a public-interest litigation (PIL) filed by a former woman IAS officer seeking directions to the government to ensure safety of women and for conduct of fast-track court proceedings in all rape cases.

A bench headed by Chief Justice Altamas Kabir will hear on Thursday the PIL which seeks suspension of MPs and MLAs in case a chargesheet is filed against them for crime against women.

In her PIL, retired IAS officer Promilla Shanker has pleaded with the court to direct the government to set up fast-track courts in all states for expeditious trial of rape cases.

She also submitted that cases of rape and crime against women and children should be investigated by lady police officials and trial be conducted by lady judges.

Meanwhile, another bench comprising justices P Sathasivam and Ranjan Gogoi issued notices to the Centre and all the states, and sought their response on another PIL by advocate Mukesh Kumar seeking safety measures for women.

Mr Kumar, in his PIL, demanded creation of women police stations in every town to investigate complaints of rape and sexual assault against women.

It also sought steps for implementation of UN convention on elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.

The court asked the Centre and the states to file their responses in four weeks.

The PILs come in the backdrop of the nation-wide outrage over December 16 brutal gang-rape and assault of a 23-year-old woman in Delhi, who died in a Singapore hospital on December 29.

New Delhi:
The brutal gang-rape case in Delhi has stirred state governments across the country to initiate steps to improve security for women, and review law enforcement mechanisms.

The nationwide groundswell of outrage in the wake of the medical student's horrific gang-rape, and subsequent death, has forced governments to shed characteristic apathy and indifference, and address long-overlooked issues regarding the safety of women.

Maharashtra

Maharashtra has proposed setting up a special women's cell in all police stations, counselling centres across the state, and an increase in the presence of women in the police force. Cops who fail to register a complaint of crime against women will now face action. Home Minister R R Patil has also mooted the setting up of 25 special fast-track courts to hear cases of serious crimes against women in a time-bound manner.

Rajasthan

In Rajasthan, the Jaipur district administration has launched a 24-hour helpline for women called 'Garima'. The number - 7891091111 - has facilities for making calls, sending SMS, and e-mails. District officials promise that counsellors manning the helpline will also call back those who make missed calls to these numbers and, with the help of NGOs and the police, will try and resolve the caller's problems. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, Jaipur is among the five most unsafe cities for women in the country.

Tamil Nadu   

Yesterday, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa announced a 13-point action plan that her government will implement to counter crimes against women. This includes the establishment of special Mahila fast-track courts in each district, installation of Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) in all public buildings, and deployment of police personnel in plainclothes at public places frequented by women.

Karnataka

The state government has said that soon all taxis, autorickshaws, and state transport buses will be equipped with surveillance cameras. Taxis and autorickshaws will also be GPS-enabled. The state government has also proposed booking rape offenders under the stringent Goonda Act, which allows for preventive detention without bail.

Uttar Pradesh
 
The state has mooted booking sexual offenders under the National Security Act, which allows the government to keep them behind bars for a year.

Meanwhile, the Delhi Police is expected file its chargesheet against the six accused in the gang-rape case today. The Chief Justice of India will inaugurate the first of five fast-track courts to ensure speedy justice for women in the capital at Saket today. 'Amanat's' (NOT her real name) case will be heard here. All five courts will start functioning from tomorrow and hear cases on a daily basis.

Amanat was assaulted with an iron rod and raped by six men on a moving bus on December 16 in the capital. She died on December 29 at a hospital in Singapore, where she had been flown for treatment. The incident stirred a series of demonstrations across the country - Delhi being the epicentre - with students and activists demanding tougher punishment for rapists as well as measures to enhance the safety of women.

'Amanat' case: bone test for juvenile suspect

New Delhi:
A bone test is being conducted to confirm the age of a juvenile suspect in custody for the fatal assault and gang-rape of a young woman, while prosecutors will seek the death penalty for the other five men arrested with him, police said on Tuesday.

The six will be formally charged in court on Thursday on accusations that they kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered the 23-year-old woman on a moving bus in the capital New Delhi on December 16, police spokesman Rajan Bhagat told reporters.

Media reports say some 30 witnesses have been gathered, and the charges have been detailed in a document running into more than 1,000 pages.

Outraged Indians have been demanding the death penalty for the six men, holding demonstrations almost every day since the rape. Murder is punishable by death and rape by life imprisonment. But juveniles - those below 18 years of age - cannot be prosecuted for murder.

Another police officer said a bone test is being conducted to determine if the youngest suspect in the case is indeed a juvenile. If the test determines he is 18 years or older he will be treated as a legal adult, said the officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose sensitive information.

The brutality of this case has made Indians confront the reality that sexual violence is deeply entrenched in the society. Women face daily harassment, from catcalls on streets and groping in buses to rapes. Often police refuse to accept complaints by victims and even blame them for inviting unwanted male attention by dressing provocatively. Families too dissuade victims from coming forward in the belief that it will ruin their reputations.

Activists hope that the savage assault on the young woman, a physiotherapy student, will shake off the taboo associated with sexual violence and make the authorities take such cases more seriously.

The young woman and a male companion were attacked when they got into an off-duty bus in southern New Delhi to go back home. The six men, including the bus driver, took turns to rape her and beat her with an iron bar which they also inserted in her body causing severe injuries to her organs.

The woman, who has not been identified, was airlifted to Singapore for emergency treatment but died on Saturday. She was cremated in New Delhi on Sunday, and the ashes were to be submerged in the holy river Ganges near her hometown in the northern Uttar Pradesh state in accordance with Hindu customs.

Protesters and politicians from across the spectrum called for a special session of Parliament to pass new laws to increase punishments for rapists - including possible chemical castration - and to set up fast-track courts to deal with rape cases within 90 days.

Thousands of Indians have lit candles, held prayer meetings and marched through various cities and towns to express their grief and demand stronger protection for women and the death penalty for rape, which is now punishable by a maximum of life imprisonment. The protests continued on Tuesday.

On Monday, the Indian army and navy canceled their New Year's Eve celebrations, as did Sonia Gandhi, head of the ruling Congress party. Several hotels and clubs across the capital also did not hold their usual parties.

New Delhi:
First they brutally beat and gang-raped the 23-year-old medical student in a moving bus. Then, they threw her and her friend, also badly beaten, out of the bus. And then, the six men accused of murdering the young woman in a case that has shaken a nation's conscience, allegedly tried to drive the bus over the couple.

The friend pulled her to safety, just in time, police sources say. This is one of many shocking details now emerging of what happened on the evening of Sunday, December 16, as the Delhi Police puts together a 1000-page chargesheet which it plans to submit in a Delhi court on Thursday.

The sources said the police chargesheet is likely to give details of the horrific brutality of the six men and the valiant attempt of the young woman and her friend, hopelessly outnumbered, to fight them off. In that effort, as she was pinned down and raped, the young woman bit three of the men assaulting her. The bite marks on the three accused men are likely to be part of the Delhi Police's evidence, the sources say.

The woman died on Saturday last after a 13-day struggle to survive injuries so grievous that her intestines had to be removed and she had three major surgeries and a cardiac arrest before being flown to Singapore. She died in hospital there of severe organ failure. The Mount Elizabeth Hospital where she died is expected to send its post mortem report to the Delhi Police soon. It will be one of the most crucial pieces of evidence in the case that the police is building against the six accused.

Key testimony also lies in the statement of the software engineer who was accompanying Amanat (NOT her real name) on the bus and was assaulted with an iron rod by the six drunk men on board when he tried to protect her.

According to the police, when the woman and her male friend boarded the private bus at the Munirka bus-stop in south Delhi, they saw some men sitting inside, who seemed to be passengers. The unsuspecting couple, the police sources say, did not know realise that all these men were, in fact, part of a group. A little later, as the bus moved, the men came together and confronted the woman for being out late with a man. A scuffle began and the woman's friend reportedly hit out at one of the accused; his friends pulled out an iron rod and began to beat up first the man and then the woman too, because she put up a fight.

Sources say the police has found out that the girl was taken to the back of the bus and held down by two of the accused, a man named Akshay Thakur and another who is a minor and cannot be named. As she fought the men, the woman bit Akshay, the main accused Ram Singh, and another man accused, Vinay Sharma. Forensic tests will establish who bit them, say police sources.

One of the charges against Ram Singh, the driver of the bus, is destruction of evidence; he allegedly washed down the bus to erase all proof of the crime and also burnt the clothes that the men had snatched off the victims before throwing them on the road.

The police have added dacoity to the list of charges against the six men; they have already been charged with murder, attempt to murder, gang-rape, kidnapping and robbery. The first draft of the chargesheet, sources say, cites around 30 to 40 witnesses, including the doctors who treated the student, first in Delhi, and then at the Singapore hospital.

While in critical condition in hospital, Amanat shared her testimony with two different judges. Her account was not video-taped, but will be the most important evidence in the trial. Daily hearings have been promised by the Delhi High Court and the government, to ensure that a verdict is reached quickly.

Senior police sources say that the chargesheet has been vetted by legal experts, and that the police will ask for the death penalty for the six men who have been charged with Amanat's rape and murder. The minor cannot be tried in court. A report will be sent to the Juvenile Justice Board, which will handle his case.

The police has also filed a cheating and forgery case against the bus owner Dinesh Yadav for gaining permit to operate buses on basis of papers with forged address.

The unabated monstrosity of the attack on Amanat has walloped India, stirring anger and protests, with thousands pledging to fight in her memory for better safety for women and tougher laws for those convicted of rape. Activists also point out the need for fast-track trials for rape cases to counter the perception that the notoriously slow legal system allows those accused of sexual and other crimes to escape punishment.

Chennai:
As India mourns the death of the 23-year-old medical student who was brutally gang-raped in Delhi, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa has demanded harsher punishment, including ""death penalty and chemical castration"" for those accused of rape. She has also announced a series of steps to check and tackle cases of sexual crimes against women in the state and ensuring their safety.

In a 13-point action plan that was unveiled today, Ms Jayalalithaa said steps will be taken to set up Fast Track Mahila Courts in each district in the state to expedite hearing of cases of sexual assault. ""Daily hearing shall be conducted in all such sexual abuse cases to finish trial fast... the government counsel in such cases will all be women,"" the chief minister said. Incidents of sexual assault will be treated as a grave crime and top police officials would probe them, she added.

The chief minister also said that enquiry in all pending cases of sexual abuse shall be expedited and a report will be submitted in 15 days.

Even as a panel set up by the Centre reviews changes in the existing laws to provide for stricter punishment for sexual offenders, Ms Jayalalithaa said that she would request the government to make necessary changes in the law to provide death penalty and chemical castration to those involved in such crimes. ""The Centre will be requested to amend the laws to ensure the maximum punishment of death penalty and chemical castration for those responsible for rapes. The offence should also be made non-bailable,"" the Chief Minister said.

The state government has also issued orders to put in place close-circuit television (CCTV) sets in all public buildings to identify those who trouble women, she said. Police personnel in plainclothes would be deployed at market places and colleges to ensure the safety of women.

Besides meeting the entire medical expenses of women who suffered sexual assault, efforts would also be made for their rehabilitation, the Chief Minister said.

The move comes in the wake of a wave of protests across the country - with Delhi serving as the epicentre - after Amanat (NOT her real name) was beaten with an iron rod and raped by six men on a moving bus on December 16. She died on Saturday morning at a hospital in Singapore. The incident stirred a series of demonstrations with students and activists demanding tougher punishment for rapists as well as steps to ensuring the safety of women.

Beijing:
India's ""inefficient and unequal democracy"" cannot provide answers to social evils and that is why angry citizens are taking to the streets, an influential Chinese newspaper has said.

""The Indian democratic system seemingly can't solve these problems but provides legitimacy for them,"" the Global Times said in a commentary after the death of a 23-year-old who had been gang-raped and tortured in Delhi.

""India's democracy is now manipulated by a small number of elite and interest groups. This easily ignites massive grass-roots protests like the current ones and the anti-corruption rallies in August.""

The street protests in New Delhi offered a lesson to China, said the Global Times write-up by Lin Xu.

""Six decades ago, China and India maintained a similar development level, but there has been a widening gap after China explored reform and opening-up,"" it said.

""Analysts hold that India is about a decade behind China in economic development and three decades behind in social development,"" it said.

But the Times noted that as the world's biggest democratic country, India was seen in the West as having great potential due to its superior system.

""But an inefficient and unequal democracy is unlikely to be able to mobilize this potential. The Indian government is criticized for having reacted slowly and India's law enforcement system is considered sloppy. Rape cases in India have a conviction rate of as low as 26 percent even when they reach court. Moreover, the traditional social culture that devalues women should be condemned. Democracy should ensure effective public participation in national politics and supervision of the government. Efficient democracy means more than electoral politics,"" it said.

Global Times, which represents hardline thinking in China, went on to say that the abuse of women in India was shocking.

It quoted statistics to say that 572 rapes were recorded in New Delhi in 2011, and rape cases went up seven times in the past 40 years.

""Over the past few weeks, violence against women in India received prominent attention worldwide, most of which dwelt on the root causes of the problem.""

New Delhi:
The family of the 23-year-old medical student who died after being brutally gang-raped on December 16 said they would not rest until her killers are hanged as police finalised their investigation before charges are laid against suspects this week.

As the ruling Congress party reportedly pushed for tougher punishments for sex crimes, including chemical castration, authorities in Delhi launched a hotline to improve safety for women in a city dubbed 'India's rape capital'.

Around 400 university students gathered in central Delhi on Monday, vowing to continue their 'movement' until better safety measures are put in place and the guilty punished.

The woman, whom friends say was planning to marry in February, died of her injuries on Saturday in a Singapore hospital, nearly two weeks after being savagely attacked by men on a bus in Delhi. She was cremated on Sunday.

""The fight has just begun. We want all the accused hanged and we will fight for that, till the end,"" her brother told a newspaper in an interview published on Monday.

Delhi police said their probe was almost complete, pending the arrival of an autopsy report from doctors in Singapore and the conclusions of forensic experts, with charges to be unveiled on Thursday.

""It is up to the court to decide when the trial would begin,"" said police spokesman Rajan Bhagat.

Five men will face murder charges after allegedly luring the 23-year-old medical student onto a bus on December 16, and then taking it in turns to rape her and assault her with an iron bar before throwing her out of the moving vehicle.

The man whom she was hoping to marry, a 28-year-old software engineer, was also left with serious injuries after he too was attacked and dumped on the roadside.

His relatives told a newspaper that he had taken part in an identification parade of suspects at New Delhi's high-security Tihar jail.

While the country returned to work after a weekend marked by candlelit vigils and street protests, few people were in the mood to celebrate New Year. Many bars as well as the armed forces cancelled or toned down festivities.

Seeking to assuage anger at police and local officials for failing to prevent widespread violence against women, the Delhi government announced compensation of 1.5 million rupees (Rs 15 lakh) for the family of the murdered woman and promised one of her relatives a government job.

The young woman's father spoke of the impact of the tragedy on the family.

""My wife had hardly eaten in the last two weeks,"" he told the newspaper.

""She was exhausted... I think she was not ready to face the shock of our daughter's death, despite doctors always telling us that she was serious. She cried intermittently all of Saturday, but it got worse on the flight back home.""

The father, who was at his daughter's bedside when she was pronounced dead in Singapore, said he too was struggling to accept the news.

""It is too painful. I have not gone inside her room. She was born in this house. Her books, clothes, they are all here,"" he said.

The attack has led to widespread calls for rapists to be executed in a country where the crime is so commonplace that it rarely gets a mention in the papers.

India does have the death penalty for ""the rarest of rare"" crimes although executions are only occasionally carried out.

Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving gunman of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, was hanged last month but it was the first execution for eight years.

Rattled by the angry protests, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has ordered a retired judge, JS Verma, to lead a review of laws on sex crimes.

According to reports on Monday, Singh's own Congress party may propose in its submissions to Mr Verma's inquiry that rapists serve up to 30 years behind bars and be chemically castrated.

""Certain proposals have been made but we cannot officially comment at this stage because the draft is not ready as yet,"" said a party spokesman.

The makeshift memorial at Jantar Mantar
New Delhi:
In mourning over the death of a young medical student who was raped by six men on a bus in Delhi, many in India are scaling down or cancelling their plans for New Year's Eve.

This evening, protesters returned to Jantar Mantar, where on Saturday evening, hours after the girl died, thousands gathered with candles and pledged to fight for women's rights in her memory.

A makeshift memorial consisting of flowers, candles and placards with tributes and condolence messages has been created there.

The Indian armed forces have announced that their New Year celebrations stand cancelled.

Leading private members' club, the Delhi Gymkhana, where top officials and ministers are often seen, cancelled its party as did the Press Club in the capital.

The five-star Ashoka hotel in New Delhi also closed its popular nightclub, while other bar owners were quoted in the media as saying they were scaling back festivities.

""This New Year is not going to be the same for me and many of my friends,"" said Ashish Gupta, a 34-year-old chartered accountant who joined protests against the crime on Sunday.

""Our heart goes out to the family of the woman who fought for her life so bravely. The least we can do is show our respect and send out the message that we share their grief,"" he said.

New Delhi:
The protests in Delhi continued today with many pledging to hold their ground at places like Jantar Mantar till they see evidence of the government's commitment to stricter laws for cases of sexual assault.

The 23-year-old student who was cremated in the early hours of Saturday in the capital has provoked shame, introspection and the unequivocal demand for more safety for women.

Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde said that he has invited all political parties to suggest the changes that should be incorporated in existing criminal laws to provide more severe punishment for those convicted of rape.

The opposition has been asking the government to call a meeting of all parties and a special session of parliament to discuss possible changes to the law, a point raised again today by BJP leader Sushma Swaraj.

Sources say that instead, the government wants to wait till a report on potential amendments is readied by a three-member team headed by retired Supreme Court judge Justice JS Verma, which has been given a month for its submission.   After that, the government is likely to invite all parties for a discussion on the report.

In the two weeks that the student fought for her life in hospital, the government was criticized repeatedly for its clumsy responses to protestors and its perceived distance from public sentiment.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi have committed in televised addresses to ensuring that the six men arrested for the student's rape and murder get the ""severest punishment."" A committee headed by a retired Delhi High Court judge is looking at the lapses that allowed the savage attack on the student; the same team will suggest how to make Delhi safer for women.

New Delhi:
The young woman who died after being gang-raped in Delhi was to marry her boyfriend who was injured in the same attack, neighbours said on Sunday.

A neighbour said that she had been shopping with the 23-year-old medical student for wedding outfits and the contents of a wedding box known as trousseau.

""They had made all the wedding preparations and had planned a wedding party in Delhi,"" she told reporters. ""We know that she was going to get married in February,"" she said. ""The whole neighbourhood was excited about it.""

The boyfriend also suffered serious injuries during a prolonged assault on a bus on the night of December 16 after they had spent the evening watching a movie at a multiplex in the Saket district of Delhi. He has not spoken since the attack which reports said began when he defended his girlfriend after she was initially verbally abused by a group of six men.

 Apple of her father's eye

The girl was the apple of her father's eye and her friends were convinced she would achieve great things after completing her medical studies.

While India has seen an outpouring of grief for the 23-year-old who suffered fatal injuries when she was gang-raped on December 16, those who actually knew her paint a portrait of a young woman who was both in love and much loved.

Although not formally engaged, it was well-known by her friends that she was planning to marry the boyfriend who also suffered serious injuries in the same attack that would ultimately lead to her death.

The young couple had spent the evening together at a mall watching The Life of Pi before they boarded a bus they thought would take them home.

The everyday image of a young couple enjoying a night out at the movies has been cited by many people to explain why they have been able to relate so much to the plight of someone whose name they will never know.

But others have identified with the backstory of a hardworking student whose family hail from rural India but who was looking to make a name for herself as a young urban professional with the eager backing of her proud parents.

Her parents sold their small piece of land in rural Uttar Pradesh in order to fund their daughter's education, often limiting their own meals to little more than rotis with namak (bread with salt).

New Delhi:
As outrage continues against the death of 23-year-old medical student 'Amanat' (NOT her real name), Congress has decided to propose a tougher law to check crimes against women which could include a provision like chemical castration of perpetrators of rape in rare cases.

The final draft of the Congress' bill, which is to be submitted to the Justice J S Verma-led Committee set up by the Centre in the wake of the horrific incident on December 16, has not, however been readied yet, the sources said.

Some of the provisions of this tougher law include imprisonment up to 30 years for rape convicts and setting up of fast track-courts to decide the cases within 3 months and were discussed in the presence of party chief Sonia Gandhi on
December 23 when she held a meeting with a group of people protesting against the gang-rape incident.

The Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council, which has framed and helped frame many landmark legislations like RTI, is likely to be involved in the whole exercise.

Sources said the Women and Child Development Ministry, headed by Krishna Tirath, held a marathon meeting with stakeholders on this issue on Friday during which several suggestions have been made.

The ministry will a prepare a summary of the suggestions received and will submit it to the Justice Verma-headed three-member committee set up to review existing laws make recommendations changes in them to effectively check crimes against women.

New Delhi:
After her 23-year-old daughter was cremated, her mother collapsed and was rushed to hospital.

The story of the young woman who fought so courageously for her life for two weeks after she was raped by six men on a bus in Delhi has stung, hurt and shamed the country, with thousands vowing that the young woman's death will not be in vain, a pledge echoed by the Prime Minister and other government officials.

'Amanat' (not her real name) died in Singapore on Saturday morning, three days after her parents flew with her on an air ambulance to a hospital, leaving behind a country praying for a miracle.

Her mother, 45, was reportedly who Amanat communicated with most in the past 13 days that she spent in hospital. Three days after her savage attack, she told her mother that she wanted to live.

Doctors who attended to her mother today say she needs counselling for her trauma. She did not eat anything in the hours she spent at the hospital, sipping some milk instead.

Doctors said she appeared to have not eaten properly for nearly two weeks.

Amanat was a remarkably committed and good student, determined to study medicine. She coached many children in her neighbourhood. She helped bring up her two younger brothers.  She was hoping to get married in February, neighbours said.

They knew of her relationship with a young software engineer, who watched The Life of Pi with her at a South Delhi mall on Sunday night.

They decided to take a bus home. When six drunk men on board including the driver began harassing her, he tried to intervene. They hit first him and then her with an iron rod. Then they took turns raping her before throwing the couple onto the road.

The barbarous contours of the crime incensed India, and students and others held near-daily protests demanding better safety for women and a faster and more effective process of trials for rape cases. Some have been petitioning for the death penalty for extreme cases of sexual assault.

The six men have been arrested, charged with murder and their trial is likely to begin on January 3

Over 2000 policemen were on guard outside the cremation ground for Amanat.

The Prime Minister and congress president Sonia Gandhi had received her family at the airport.

New Delhi:
Protests on crime against women took an ugly turn this afternoon at Jantar Mantar, in the heart of the capital, when a group of around 50 people, who reportedly infiltrated the peaceful protest, tried to break down barricades set up by police. Five people have been detained so far in the case.

Hundreds of protesters had gathered to mourn the death of the 23-year-old medical student who was cremated on Sunday morning. Comprising mostly students, they were demanding tougher anti-rape laws.

According to reports, at around 1 pm a group affiliated to a political party tried to storm the iron barricades and clash with the police. Police immediately swung into action to contain them. However they restrained from using force to disperse the unruly group.

Speaking to NDTV, one of the protesters alleged that some political elements are trying to infiltrate and hijack the movement. He said, ""Some of these youth political parties who are coming here have their vested interests. They are the hooligans. We are disappointed. For the past week we have tried to build this movement. They are actually trying to make this movement die.""

Heavy security is in place at Jantar Mantar where the protest is being held. Police have imposed prohibitory orders around India Gate and Raisina Hill and barricaded all roads leading to the area, as well as shutting down several Metro stations in central Delhi.

New Delhi:
There has been only one conviction out of over 600 cases of rape reported to Delhi Police this year even as crime against women has been on the rise in the national capital.

As many as 754 accused were arrested in the 635 cases reported to Delhi Police between January and November, the highest in past five years, Home Ministry said. Of all the accused, only one was convicted while 403 are facing trials and investigations are pending against 348 and two others were discharged.

A total of 572 rape cases were reported to Delhi Police last year as against 507 in 2010, 469 in 2009 and 466 in 2008. The Delhi Police arrested 745 accused last year. Of these, 18 were convicted, 34 were acquitted, 597 are facing trials in different courts, 86 are still being investigated and 10 were discharged for the crime.

In 2010, out of 685 arrested accused, 37 were convicted and 107 were acquitted. Trials are on against 518 accused and investigations were pending against 13 others, the data said. In the previous two years 1279 people were arrested for rape. Of these, 82 were convicted in 2009 and 52 in 2008.

As many as 211 people were acquitted in 2009 and 119 in 2008.

During 2009, investigation was pending against one accused and in 2008, probe involving 17 accused was yet to be completed, the Home Ministry said.

The national capital has also reported 624 cases of molestation of women between January and November and the police have arrested 768 accused. However, conviction was done in only one case. The trials were pending against 402 accused and investigations were pending against 356 others suspected to have molested women, it said.

New Delhi:
Every month a 16-year-old boards a train from her remote village in eastern India and steels herself for another round of searing cross-examination by lawyers about the men who kidnapped, raped and sold her.

While the tragic killing of a medical student after she was gang-raped in Delhi has triggered an outpouring of angry protests and attracted global headlines, the ordeal of this young village girl in West Bengal is an equally damning indictment of the fate of sex attack victims in India.

""I hear about the Delhi rape case on the radio every day,"" she told AFP in a phone interview from her home. ""Only a rape victim can understand the grief of another rape victim. She died but I have to live to fight on.""

On a summer's day in 2010, while working at her family shop in her village, she says two boys offered her an ice cold soda, laced with sedatives.

She regained consciousness in a train compartment in the presence of three men. When they arrived at a Delhi station, the men frogmarched her to an apartment, she says.

""They locked me in a room, forced me to stay silent by attacking me with shoes and sticks and then they raped me.""

The 14-year-old was then sold to a brothel in the capital.

""Drivers, old men, poor men and some rich boys, they all exploited me for a year,"" said the teen, who was rescued along with 10 other girls by the police and a voluntary organisation during a series of raids in the capital's red light district.

But her struggle was far from over. When she arrived home, she found no one supported her decision to register a police case.

""In a city, a girl still has the freedom to decide, but in a village she cannot make a decision against the wishes of a village head. A woman has to obey her father, brothers, village men,"" she said.

""Why would one man punish another man? But I registered a police case against my kidnappers, rapists and traffickers.""

It took the brutal multiple rape and murder of the 23-year-old student in the capital to push the epidemic of sexual violence against women onto the front pages, but the real epicentre is in the villages.

The teen's village, like thousands of Indian villages, is a tight-knit, mainly agrarian community where family honour and the avoidance of shame are a matter of life and death.

Women are never given the freedom to voice their opinion. Men take decisions on their behalf, including the clothes they wear and whether they can go out or not.

The local police is often reluctant to pursue cases of sex assault. Only last week, a teenager in Punjab committed suicide after she was allegedly asked to drop her complaint in exchange for cash or by agreeing to marry one of her attackers.

But this 16-year-old wanted the world to know what happened. She says too many victims are either afraid or ashamed to speak out.

Her fight for justice has been supported by Shakti Vahini, a voluntary organisation that provides her with legal aid.

""But the confidence and the commitment to fight is solely hers,"" said Rishi Kant of Shakti Vahini.

Kant, who has been facilitating raids in red light districts of New Delhi for over 12 years, said the city is a hub for sex trafficking, but despite the increase in sex attacks, the number of convictions has fallen.

New Delhi has been dubbed the ""rape capital"" of India, with a rape reported on average every 18 hours, according to police figures.

The lack of women officers has been widely blamed for the failures of police forces to thoroughly investigate allegations of sex crimes. Women currently account for fewer than one in five Indian police officers.

The West Bengal teen was forced to record her statement -- and the details of her abuse -- before male officers.

Three of her alleged attackers were promptly arrested and charged but two years later they are all out on bail. India's notoriously slow justice system allows defence lawyers to spin the case out as it goes through the courts.

Her family's home has been destroyed and their rice field torched after she refused to withdraw the case.

That defiant streak has enabled to her endure the humiliating questions in the packed courtroom where she is asked to recall minute details of each assault.

""They once asked me how many times did I sleep with men? I replied: 'I never slept with them, they raped me'.

""A lawyer then asked how much money did I make at the brothel? I said, the men just threw a few coins at my face, so they could hurt me more.""

Asked if she believes she will ever get justice, she replied: ""At least I'm trying.""

Supreme Court lawyer Dayan Krishnan has been appointed as the special public prosecutor by city police to conduct trial in the December 16 gang rape of a paramedical student who succumbed to injuries during wee hours today at a Singapore hospital.

The senior police officer said the harshest punishment would be sought against five accused during the trial after filing the charge sheet by January 3.

The sixth accused is a juvenile and would be tried separately at Juvenile Justice Board.

""We hope to file the charge sheet by January 3, 2013. Section 302 of the IPC, which is the penal section for murder, has been added in the FIR,"" Kumar said, adding, ""It will be our endeavor to ensure the harshest punishment in the book for the culprits.""

The special prosecutor would conduct the trial in a fast track court on day-to-day basis.

Later talking to PTI, Krishnan said, ""I had given my consent to conduct the trial."" Krishnan has been representing NIA, Delhi Police and other agencies at various judicial fora in many cases including the Nitish Katara murder case.

The girl, who died today at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore owing to mutiple organ failure, was gangraped, assaulted and then dumped in south Delhi by six persons on the night of December 16.

She and her male friend had boarded the bus at Munirka around 9.45 pm on the fateful night after watching a movie.

A special aircraft of national carrier Air India will bring back the body of the 23-year-old student who died in a hospital in Singapore early this morning.  She was raped two weeks ago by six drunk men on a moving bus in Delhi. They also hit her male companion and her with an iron rod before throwing them onto the road.

""The government has chartered an Airbus 319, which took-off in the morning and landed in Singapore around 1 p.m. (Indian time),"" a senior Air India official told IANS.

Four government officials have accompanied the crew to Singapore. Four police officers including a woman cop are also on board the plane, said sources to NDTV. The plane is expected to land in Delhi around 10 pm.

The monstrous attack on the student has jolted India into action. Nearly every day, protestors have been demanding justice for the student, better policing, and a faster and more effective legal system to handle cases of sexual assault.

Five of the six men arrested for the murderous attack on a 23-year-old student in a moving bus are being kept in a high-security part of Tihar Jail in Delhi, a precaution taken after the student died this morning at a hospital in Singapore. Police sources believe that other prisoners are likely to attack the men; they are being kept in cells  with special locks.  

The sixth person arrested is a minor and is at a juvenile home.

Two weeks ago, they assaulted the girl and her male friend with an iron rod on a bus usually used to transport school children. The driver of the bus took it for a spin with his friends, and when they saw the couple waiting on the road side, they pulled up and posed as a chartered bus, commonly used in  Delhi to supplement public transport. After their depraved attack, they dumped the couple on a road.

The girl was assaulted so relentlessly that she had to go through three major surgeries; she also had a cardiac arrest and  what doctors described as ""a serious brain injury.""

She was flown on an air ambulance to Singapore on Wednesday night.

New Delhi:
Serious swelling in the brain resulting from the cardiac arrest she suffered a few days ago was an ""important cause"" that led to the death of 23-year-old medical student who fought for her life with ""great fortitude and courage"".

Cerebral edema, a condition characterised by excess accumulation of water in the intracellular or extracellular spaces of the brain, proved fatal in the case of the paramedic student who was airlifted to Singapore on Wednesday night for specialised treatment.

The young girl suffered a cardiac arrest on Tuesday night which caused severe injuries to her brain as well.

Complications in brain along with multi-organ failure took the life of the victim at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore.

""Brain injury is an important cause for the death. She suffered a cardiac arrest at Safdarjung Hospital on Tuesday. This could have caused the brain injury and she also suffered from multi-organ failure,"" Dr Yatin Mehta, Chairman Institute of Critical Care and Anaesthesiology at Medanta Medicity, told PTI.

He said that in such cases the death is finally due to cardiac arrest.

Dr Mehta, who was by the side of the girl in the air ambulance in which she was airlifted to Singapore, said the girl's blood pressure was normal and her heart was pumping blood till last evening when he had left Singapore for India.

""Her lungs were infected slightly yesterday but her blood pressure was normal,"" he said, adding that she was an ""extremely brave girl"" and a ""role model"" who fought back after suffering grievous injuries.

Cerebral edema is a serious medical condition where there is way more fluid in the skull than there should be causing swelling in brain which compromises its own blood flow.

About the nearly six-hour journey to Singapore, Dr Mehta said the victim's blood pressure dipped very low for a few minutes but it was brought to normal level immediately. ""It was just for a temporary period. She responded quite well. In fact, she responded better than what I was expecting. Till yesterday, her blood pressure was normal and she took the treatment very well,"" he said.

Maintaining that the girl was air-lifted only with an aim to get best of the treatment for her, the doctor paid rich tributes to her courage.

""She was an extremely brave girl. She is a role model for everyone. She fought back,"" he said and noted that it was time for action.

""As a society we should unite and fight against such crimes. It is not just enough that people shed artificial tears and forget. We should work hard,"" he said.

The 23-year-old student who died in a hospital in Singapore today was flown on an air ambulance from Delhi three nights ago. Dr Yatin Mehta had accompanied her; he saw her for the last time at 10 am on Friday.

""She remained serious...but not that serious...I wasn't expecting her to go so soon,"" said Dr Mehta, who is the Chairman of Critical Care at the Medanta Hospital in Gurgaon.

He told NDTV that the ""chances of revival were not high"" on account of the enormous injuries she suffered when she was hit with an iron rod and gang-raped by six men on a Delhi bus earlier this month.

While she was in a Delhi hospital, Amanat (NOT her real name) recorded her testimony before a judge twice, even as she was in critical condition.  ""I think this could probably have been handled better,"" Dr Mehta said.

The first time that she recorded her statement, the magistrate accused the police of ""interference"" and said senior officers had dissuaded the student's mother from allowing the testimony to be video-taped.  The police countered the allegations, and said it was Amanat's mother who was not comfortable with an on-camera statement.  Her statement was then recorded a second time.  It was not videotaped and will be used in the trial of the six men who have been arrested and accused of her murder.

Dr Mehta also refuted criticism by other doctors who have said in recent interviews that Amanat should not have been moved from Delhi while she was in critical condition.

""Doctors are always at (their) best to criticise the decisions of other doctors and that is not fair,"" he said.

""Secondly, there is no comparison between government hospitals in India and Mount Elizabeth in Singapore. I am not talking about the expertise of the doctors but about the infrastructure. We need to acknowledge that,"" the doctor added.

Protests were held in Delhi and other cities all day today in memory of the 23-year-old medical student who died in a Singapore hospital early this morning. The body of 'Amanat' (NOT her real name) will be brought back to India on a chartered Air India plane along with her family members.

Here are the latest developments:

In Delhi, hundreds of people gathered at Jantar Mantar and at sunset, the numbers were growing. Many carried placards highlighting the lack of safety for women. Candlelight protests were also held in Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Kolkata.
Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit tried to join the demonstration in the afternoon but left after lighting a candle as many in the crowd heckled her. They said they did not want to politicise today's somber proceedings.
Early in the morning, the police sealed all access to India Gate where thousands of protesters clashed with cops last weekend. 5,000 policemen and security personnel, some in riot gear, stood guard near the monument in the heart of Delhi.
Ms Dikshit had asked Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde to allow the protesters to go to India Gate, but her request was turned down. She also appealed for calm in the city.
Dozens of students of Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi marched silently to the bus stop from where the girl and her friend had boarded the bus on December 16. They carried placards reading, ""She is not with us but her story must awaken us.""
The six men arrested for the depraved attack on Amanat have now been accused of murder. The police is working on a 1000-page chargesheet against them; the trial could begin in the first week of January when courts reopen after a winter break.
Five of the arrested men are in Delhi's Tihar Jail and have been moved to high-security cells to prevent potential attacks from other prisoners. The sixth, a minor, is at a juvenile home in Delhi.
Police spokesman Rajan Bhagat said the six face death penalty if convicted.
Doctors who attended to Amanat in Singapore said: ""She was courageous in fighting for her life for so long against the odds, but the trauma to her body was too severe for her to overcome.""

New Delhi:
Delhi Police have added the charge of murder under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code against the men accused of raping and torturing the 23-year-old medical student who died in a Singapore hospital early this morning.

All the six accused have been arrested. They had so far been charged with gang-rape, kidnapping, unnatural offences, hurting in committing robbery and common intention under the Indian Penal Code. The Delhi Police has said it will file a chargesheet by Wednesday,  January 3. It is expected to run to about 1000 pages.

Forensic reports in the case are expected on Monday.

On the evening of December 16, a Sunday, the young woman boarded a private bus on her way back home with a male friend. The six men on the bus first taunted the couple for being out late together and then, after an altercation, beat the friend with an iron rod and then took turns to rape  the woman, also beating and assaulting her with the iron rod. They then threw the couple out of the bus on a flyover, where they were found by a passer-by who called the police.

The woman suffered injuries so severe that her intestines had to be removed. She also had injuries to her brain and abdomen and underwent three major surgeries and a cardiac arrest in her 10 days in the intensive care unit of the Safdarjung Hspital in Delhi, before she was taken to Singapore in an air ambulance on Thursday morning. She died today after severe organ failure.

Four of the men accused were arrested within two days of the incident. The fifth, a minor, was arrested from Uttar Pradesh last week and a sixth from Bihar the next day.

The main accused is Ram Singh, the driver of the bus that the young woman was raped in. He refused to undergo a test identification parade, but his brother, Mukesh Singh,  has been identified by the friend who was travelling with the woman on the bus in which she was gang-raped. He has also identified the minor, who too agreed to an identification parade.

New Delhi:
The doctors who supervised Amanat (NOT her real name) have refuted criticism of the decision to fly her from Delhi to Singapore in an air ambulance on Wednesday night.

Amanat died in hospital early this morning after severe organ failure. After she was gang-raped and hit by an iron rod by six men on a Delhi bus, she had a serious brain injury, three surgeries and a heart attack.

""The pure intention was to save her. The whole nation was praying for her and everyone was hoping for the best. We could not have given hope. We wanted to save her,"" said Dr BD Athani, the medical superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital, where Amanat was treated for ten days.

Dr Yatin Mehta, of the Medanta Medicity Hospital, who accompanied Amanat on the air ambulance to Singapore, said he was surprised by criticism from other doctors of the transfer.

""It was always a clever retrospection. Doctors are always at (their) best to criticise the decisions of other doctors and that is not fair,"" Dr Mehta said.

""Secondly, there is no comparison between government hospitals in India and Mount Elizabeth in Singapore. I am not talking about the expertise of the doctors but about the infrastructure. We need to acknowledge that,"" Dr Mehta said.

Dr Athani said Amanat was stable and showed signs of improvement for the first five days of treatment but her condition deteriorated after that due to severe sepsis in her body.

""She had immense fighting spirit, made two statements to police even during such times and was physiologically fit. She was alert, conscious and relevant,"" the doctor said.

He said Amanat communicated mostly with her mother.

New Delhi:
President Pranab Mukherjee today condoled the death of 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name), who was gang-raped and brutalised in a moving bus in Delhi on December 16. The medical student died early this morning in a Singapore Hospital.

The President expressed his grief over the death of the girl.

The girl, who was admitted to the well-known multi-organ transplant facility Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore in an extremely critical condition, breathed her last at 4:45 AM (2:15 AM India time). She was earlier treated at the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi.

New Delhi:
As her doctors announced in Singapore that the condition of Amanat (NOT her real name) has worsened, the Delhi Police tweeted appealing to people to stay calm. ""Praying hard for the rape victim will ensure accused are given severest punishment and quickly Reqst ppl to stay calm and maintain peace (sic),"" the police tweeted.

Doctors at the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore said this evening that Amanat showed signs of severe organ failure.

The 23-year-old medical student was gang-raped in a monstrous assault by six men on a bus in Delhi on December 16. After being treated for 10 days at a Delhi hospital, she was flown on an air ambulance on Wednesday night.

Her case has driven thousands of students onto the streets to demand more safety for women and a more effective legal system for cases of sexual assault.

Over the weekend, the protests in Delhi erupted in violence. The police used tear gas, water cannons and batons to combat protesters, some of who set a car and wooden benches near India Gate on fire.

A constable injured in those clashes died in a hospital on Tuesday. In response to the torrent of public criticism, the Prime Minister reiterated on Friday that the six men who have been arrested for Amanat's attack will be punished severely and quickly. ""You have my assurance that our government is committed to bringing the guilty to justice as soon as possible,"" he said.

New Delhi:
At a time when India is teeming with anger and grief over the case of a young medical student who was gang-raped in a Delhi bus its politicians have been delivering one deplorable remark after another about women.

Dr Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, a senior leader of Mamata Banerjee's party, said today that the Park Street case - where a woman was raped by five men after she exited a nightclub - was not a case of sexual assault but a misunderstanding during a deal between a woman and her ""client"".

Dr Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar is a member of parliament from the Trinamool Congress party.

The woman who was raped told NDTV, ""I cannot imagine how a woman can say something like that about another woman, about me. Here I am waiting for justice and she has gone ahead and said something so insulting. And she is a politician! I am shocked, horrified. Where was she when I was getting raped? She is speaking with such confidence about what happened. Was she there?""

After public outrage over her remark, the politician told NDTV that she had been misquoted. ""I said it is incomparable because the Delhi rape is a heinous crime and it has jeopardised the life in such a fashion...the girl's life is in danger. She is in treatment and has undergone operation. These two cases are not comparable. And that is what I said, that these two cases are not comparable.""

In February, after the media first reported the Park Street assault, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee described the case as a fabrication constructed to embarrass her government.

Yesterday, Abhijit Mukherjee, a Congress member of parliament, also from West Bengal, and the son of the Indian President apologized for describing women protestors in Delhi as ""painted and dented."" His party said today that no action will be taken against him since he has apologized.

Another apology has been issued by CPM MLA Anisur Rehman, again from West Bengal and a former minister in the Left government there. Earlier this week, he asked the chief minister Mamata Banerjee to state her ""rate for getting raped."" He was referring to announcements of compensation made by the chief minister for a rape victim.

New Delhi:
The 23-year-old medical student, who has been fighting for her life in a Delhi hospital since she was raped by six men on a moving bus earlier this month, has been flown to Singapore for medical treatment.

Her parents are travelling with her doctors on a highly-advanced air ambulance. The government organised visas and passports for the patient and her family earlier today.

Sources say the hope is to arrange an organ transplant for her in Singapore, where she will be admitted at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. Large parts of her intestines were removed as a result of the injuries from the monstrous attack she endured.

The student has been the focus of India's attention and prayers for several days.

For the first time today, doctors attending to Amanat (NOT her real name) failed to share a medical bulletin on her condition, usually telecast live on news channels.

The student has left India amid seething public fury.

Huge protests in Delhi over the weekend were scarred by outbursts of violence. A constable trying to control the crowd died in hospital yesterday. Confusion over whether he died as a result of his injuries created a new wave of tension. (Read)

The government, which has mishandled the protests on multiple fronts, eventually announced that an expert team of judges will review criminal laws to consider enhanced punishment for sexual assault crimes.

The hospital the student is being taken to has been used in the recent past by superstar Rajinikanth who was treated for renal failure. Politician Amar Singh also underwent a kidney transplant there in 2009.

The student's treatment is now being supervised by Dr Naresh Trehan and Dr Yatin Mehta of the super-specialty Medanta Hospital located in Gurgaon near Delhi.

After questions were raised over the cause of a constable's death during violent protests last Sunday, the Delhi Police on Wednesday assigned its Crime Branch to investigate the case in which murder charges have been invoked.

Constable Subhash Tomar (47) died on Tuesday, three days after suffering injuries at India Gate where violence had erupted during protests against the gang-rape of a 23-year-old girl in a moving bus in south Delhi on December 16, police had said.

""The case has been transferred to the Crime Branch,"" Delhi Police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat said. He did not provide reasons for transferring the case from New Delhi district police to the Crime Branch.

However, sources claimed that New Delhi district police will be busy in the coming days with regard to preparations for the Republic Day parade and maintaining law and order.

Questions were raised over the cause of Tomar's death with a journalism student, who claimed to be an eye-witness, countering the police version that the constable was injured in the violence.

The police have slapped murder charges in the case.

Earlier, eight people were arrested on Monday on charges of attempt to murder.

Yesterday, Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar had said that Tomar had suffered internal injuries in neck, chest and stomach and the police were waiting for post-mortem report for the exact cause of death.

New Delhi:
Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit tonight met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and discussed with him the prevailing situation in the city arising out of widespread protests in the wake of the brutal gang-rape of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in Delhi on December 16.

Ms Dikshit apprised the Prime Minister about the steps being taken by her Government to ensure a safe environment for women in the national Capital.

The Chief Minister also conveyed her views on steps needed to be taken by various agencies to instill confidence of women in the security system, sources said.

She also sought the Prime Minister's intervention in directing the agencies concerned so that the city can be made a safer place for women, they said.

Ms Dikshit is also understood to have conveyed to the Prime Minister the need to enhance punishment for those found guilty in committing heinous crime against women as well as a fast track trial of the convict.

Delhi Government has already announced a number of steps including setting up of a control room at Chief Minister's office to receive complaints of women and take follow up action with help of police.

At a meeting with Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde yesterday, Ms Dikshit had demanded accountability of senior police officers in the gang-rape incident and sought immediate setting up of fast-track courts to try rape cases with provisions in the law even for death penalty in rare cases like the one that rocked the city.

She had also called for a ""serious look"" at VIP security deployment in the Capital, saying it cannot be an ""excuse"" for not providing security to the common man.

New Delhi:
On Monday, the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court said all cases related to sexual assaults on women in the city would be handled by fast track courts; a notification for five such courts would be made as soon as courts re-open after the winter break on January 2, he said.
Here are the 10 latest developments in this case:
The Delhi Police has registered cases against former Army Chief VK Singh and yoga teacher Baba Ramdev, accusing them of provoking protesters at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi yesterday during protests against the brutal gang-rape of a 23-year-old medical student. The police have also registered three cases of rioting and an attempt to murder case for injuries caused to constable Subhash Tomar, who is in hospital in a critical condition.
The police action comes after protesters led by Baba Ramdev and General Singh clashed with the police at Jantar Mantar yesterday, when they were prevented from marching towards India Gate, the epicentre of protests against the gang-rape of a medical student last week. The leaders had made speeches before the incident.
The Delhi Police, under immense pressure to show quick action, has said it will file a chargesheet in a week on the brutal rape of the 23-year-old medical student, Amanat (NOT her real name), in a moving bus by six men. All the accused are now in custody.
The government has also said that a judicial panel, formed to look into reviewing laws to provide speedier justice and enhanced punishment in sexual assault cases, will submit its recommendations in a month's time. ""A parliament session will be convened when a law is ready to be passed, after Justice Verma's committee's recommendations,"" said RPN Singh, Minister of State, Home Affairs.
Amanat, meanwhile, continues to be critical with doctors saying that the 23-year-old is ""very serious...and still not out of danger."" She is ""relatively composed"", though, despite her fragile condition, they say.
Monday morning began with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh addressing the nation and appealing for calm. In a short televised address, Dr Singh said, ""As a father of three daughters, I feel as strongly as you,"" but emphasised that violence would serve no purpose.
Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde told NDTV that the protesters' bid to march to Rashtrapati Bhavan wasn't right. He, however, added that his government is not opposed to peaceful protests. ""We assure the public that the guilty will be punished...We have met the agitators. Government can't go to India Gate...it's one and the same thing,"" he added.
The main opposition party, the BJP, has said the PM's response today was inadequate and has asked for an all-party meeting on the issue. It said it would also meet the President tomorrow. There has been huge criticism of the government for failing to reach out to thousands of young students leading the movement for tougher anti-rape laws and better security for women in the capital.
Delhi saw major traffic jams on several arterial roads today because of restrictions on movement in the area around India Gate, the site of clashes between the police and protesters over the weekend. All roads leading into India Gate hexagon have been closed since early this morning. Nine Metro stations in the area are also closed, causing much inconvenience to office-goers on a working Monday. Traffic snarls were reported on major roads around Pragati Maidan, the Nizamuddin Bridge, Shanti Path, Chanakyapuri, Mother Teresa Cresent Road, Mathura Road, Khan Market, Mandi House and Barakhamba Road and other sections that link into the India Gate roads.
Delhi's Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Tejinder Khanna cut short a vacation to the US and returned to the capital last night. As L-G, Mr Khanna controls the Delhi Police and his absence through a week of law and order crisis in the Capital has been slammed, not least by Delhi Chief Minster Sheila Dikshit who had demanded that he be summoned back. At the core lies an old Delhi government complaint that law and order in the city is not under its control.

New Delhi:
Former Army chief VK Singh and yoga icon Baba Ramdev have been booked by the Delhi Police for inciting mob and provoking crowd at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi yesterday. Three cases of rioting have also been registered by the police.

Protesters led by Baba Ramdev and General Singh had clashed with the police at Jantar Mantar yesterday afternoon when they were prevented from marching towards India Gate, the epicentre of protests against the gang-rape in a moving bus of 23-year-old Amanat (NOT her real name) in New Delhi on December 16.

After a brief speech at Jantar Mantar, Baba Ramdev along with General Singh and others had started marching towards India Gate but they were stopped by the police.

As soon as Baba Ramdev and General Singh got down from the dais, police had cordoned off the area and the protesters sat at the spot.

However, supporters started marching towards India Gate and tried to break the barricades following which police resorted to use of force. Two persons suffered injuries in the incident.

""Government should set up fast track courts and punish all the rapists. We want death penalty for all the accused,"" Baba Ramdev had said.

Delhi police say that the chargesheet against the six accused in the gang-rape case of December 16 - in which a 23-year-old medical student was gang-raped on a moving bus - will be filed within a week. The Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, D Murugesan, has confirmed to NDTV that five fast-track courts will start functioning in the first week of January 2013.

These courts will be notified as soon as the Delhi High Court opens after vacation on January 2. There will be day-to-day hearings of all rape cases, including the gang-rape incident, and there will be no adjournments. Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit met the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court and Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde today to discuss and finalize the setting up of fast-track courts to hear rape cases.

Agitations against the government's response to the horrific case and police excesses against protestors demanding justice for the victim and better security for women continue in New Delhi.

The Prime Minister made a brief televised statement this morning appealing for calm, but it has done little to reassure the public. Meanwhile, the condition of 'Amanat' (NOT her real name), the gang-rape survivor, continues to be critical but stable.

As India seethes with anger over the gang-rape of a young woman in a Delhi bus, the government  has said it will ask for changes to criminal laws to introduce the death penalty for ""rarest of the rare"" sexual assault cases.

Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde also said that a judicial commission is being assigned to evaluate the response by officials to the heinous attack and suggest how to improve the safety of women. (Highlights: Government committed to women's security, says Home Minister)

For now, he said, the government is adding more public buses at night for Delhi, and that all buses will be equipped with GPS tracking systems, allowing their movement to be monitored.  

In Delhi, hundreds of protesters spent the day near Rashtrapati Bhavan and India Gate demanding that representatives of the government explain what is being done to make the capital safe for women. The police teargassed the crowd and used water cannons when some protestors tried to break through the police barricades. Mr Shinde asked protesters to stay calm.

In the evening, Congress President Sonia Gandhi phoned the Prime Minister and Home Minister to demand that quick and appropriate action be taken, sources said.

Mr Shinde said that five policemen have been identified for dereliction of duty on the night when the student was raped and action will be taken against them.

He reiterated that the government will ask for a fast-track trial with daily hearings for this case.  

Yesterday, Home Secretary RK Singh provoked outrage when he said that the police in Delhi ""have no reason to be defensive"" because they had identified and arrested the six men who assaulted the girl. (Read)

Protests near Rashtrapati Bhavan on Saturday against the gang-rape of 23-year-old medical student Amanat (NOT her real name) intensified in the evening, with the demonstrators throwing stones at the police, damaging the windows of a bus, breaking barricades and attempting to move towards Parliament. The police lathicharged the protesters, injuring one person. Some policemen were seen hurling stones back at the protesters.
Here are the latest developments:
Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj called up the Prime Minister and demanded that a special session of Parliament be held to consider death sentence for heinous crimes against women. Her demand was echoed by many protesters at Rajpath.
Senior BJP leader LK Advani phoned Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde and asked him to direct the Delhi Police to show restraint towards the protesters.
A short while before that, Mr Shinde briefed the Prime Minister about the protests at Rajpath. Manmohan Singh asked him to ensure that a sense of security prevailed in Delhi.
Protests raged through the day, with thousands trying to break barricades and move from India Gate towards Rashtrapati Bhavan. The police lathicharged them and used water cannons and teargas. A police van was damaged.
The protesters refused to budge from the high-security area at Raisina Hill and clashed with the police and Rapid Action Force again towards noon. Ten students were injured and another police vehicle was damaged in the fresh round of clashes.
The police made announcements from speakers, asking the protesters to maintain peace. ""We want to speak to you and address your issues, please listen to us... Please choose a few representatives we can speak with,"" it was announced.
Roads leading to the North and South Block, Rashtrapati Bhavan and Vijay Chowk were blocked.
The police called in reinforcements; six protesters were arrested.
The Home Ministry requested for calm. ""The protesters should not turn unruly... this is our message to the protesters through NDTV... It doesn't help to break government property. This must stop immediately... It is taking away the sincerity of the protests,"" said RPN Singh, Minister of State for Home.
At the Safdarjung Hospital, doctors continued their efforts to save the gang-rape survivor. ""Her platelet count has gone up, her biological functions are returning to normal and she had sips of water and apple juice,"" doctors said.

Amid growing concerns over security on Delhi streets during night, Minister of State for Home R P N Singh on Friday night travelled incognito in a bus to see for himself the actual situation.

Mr Singh, who is in-charge of internal security, undertook the journey on a Delhi Transport Corporation bus plying on route number 604 from Moti Bagh to Chhatarpur Metro station, passing through R K Puram, Vasant Vihar, Munirka, Vasant Kunj and Chhatarpur.

He found virtually ""no security"" on the road and now would take steps to upgrade safety of citizens in Delhi. He also found women talking about the problem of safety and security in the buses and lewd comments they had to experience while travelling and after disembarking.

Home Secretary RK Singh also surveyed areas in the city.

The minister said he would be undertaking such exercises regularly so as to make Delhi a safer place.

He commended the action taken by the Delhi Police in arresting those involved in the gang rape of the 23-year-old girl on Sunday night.

New Delhi:
A public avalanche of anger has hit India's streets since a young medical student was raped by six men on a bus in Delhi on Sunday night. They first harassed Amanat (not her real name), then hit her friend who tried to intervene; when she tried to protect him, they turned their focus on her, attacking her so badly with an iron rod that most of her intestines have been removed and her doctors are not sure if she will survive.

Today, the Home Secretary, RK Singh, assigned to head a committee on improving safety in the capital, said, ""There is no reason for the Delhi Police to be defensive. They have investigated and caught five of the six culprits. If we think dispassionately, any case cracked in one or two days is brilliant work."" Mr Singh also said that the government has decided to close all bars and discotheques in the city by 1 am, including on the New Year's Eve.

His remarks come as the Delhi Police is being furiously criticised, not just for its long-standing record of turgid ineffectiveness, but because policemen failed to stop the bus as it drove through multiple check points along a 34-km route,while the woman and her friend were being attacked on board. The bus had ""School"" painted in white lettering on its side; it had tinted windows, illegal in Delhi. Yet, nobody thought to pull over a school bus that was on the roads late at night with its curtains drawn.

The first indication the police had of the heinous attack was when a passer-by phoned in to say that a couple was lying bleeding and semi-naked near a flyover in South Delhi. The police then collected the pair and headed to hospital.

""The PCR (police) Van arrived at the spot in 4 minutes, I think that is outstanding,"" the Home Secretary said. ""Was the investigation prompt and effective? Yes it was,"" he said at a press conference. ""So while we have not said no one will be held accountable, prima facie, on both counts, police cannot be faulted.""

His defense of the police is in sharp contrast to Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit, who pointed out in an interview to NDTV that the police in the capital does not report to her, but to the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi. ""I don't have the power to transfer even one constable,"" she said, ""but if police were under me I would have suspended a few policemen.""

New Delhi:
The 23-year-old medical student who was brutally raped in a moving bus in Delhi on Sunday, has been taken off the ventilator and is attempting to speak now. All six men who allegedly raped Amanat (not her real name) are now in custody. The Delhi High Court has asked the police to share the names of the cops who failed to stop the bus, which had tinted glasses, as it moved through a series of check points in Delhi while the young woman was being tortured in it.
Here are the latest developments in the investigation:
The police said that sixth accused person, who was on the run, was today arrested in Bihar. They had earlier in the day arrested one of the accused who were on the run. He is a minor. Four of the six men accused of raping the woman - the bus driver Ram Singh, his brother, Mukesh, Vinay, a gym assistant and Pawan or Kalu, a fruitseller - had been arrested earlier in the week. They have been also been charged with attempt to murder among other things.
The Home Secretary and Delhi Police chief said today that they were ""hopeful that based on circumstantial evidence, oral evidence and forensic evidence we will be able to secure conviction."" They said they would seek a swift trial and Life Imprisonment for the accused. The Delhi Police has submitted a status report on its investigations in the High Court today.
The two top officials detailed security measures taken in Delhi. Cops, they said, had removed tinted films from the windows of 464 vehicles in Delhi this week and all vehicles coming into the city from other states that had with tinted glasses were being turned back.
They said there were plainclothes cops out on the streets and also on buses to prevent loitering and misbehaviour. ""This is going to be a place where any goondagardi or dadagiri will be swiftly punished,"" Home Secretary RK Singh said. He also said that Global Positioning Service or GPS will be added to all buses and autos, adding that a chargesheet will be filed soon.
The top officials also said that a large number of contract buses that were found to be plying illegally had been impounded, their licences cancelled and these would be auctioned after receiving orders from court. Buses, autorickshaw and taxis had been instructed to display licence numbers on vehicles, they said. Auto and taxi drivers have to be verified by the police and wear badges that indicate they are authorised to be driving, officials said.
The young woman is in stable condition but her platelet count has dropped further. Doctors said they are worried about a possible infection developing in her liver. (Read) She has been through multiple surgeries and almost her entire intestines have had to be removed.
Doctors at Safdurjang Hospital have allowed the Delhi Police to record the victim's statement. The cops have been asked to prepare a written questionnaire, which she will  respond to either in writing or through gestures. She has reportedly asked for her mother to be present when her statement is recorded. (Read: 'Have they been caught?', gang-rape survivor reportedly asked)
One of the men accused, Mukesh, was identified yesterday by the victim's male friend, who was with her when the incident happened. The young man, who too was beaten on the head repeatedly with an iron rod on Sunday evening, reportedly took a minute to identify the accused out of 11 men who were paraded before him at Tihar Jail yesterday. Three of them, including Mukesh, have also confessed to the crime in court. Ram Singh has refused to participate in a test identification.
A parliamentary panel will meet on December 27 to discuss if changes need to be made in the law on rape and will make suggestions to the government for the government. The Union Home Secretary and top Delhi Police officers have been ordered to attend the meeting.
Angry demonstrations continue in Delhi; loud protests were held today outside Rashtrapati Bhawan, at the hospital where the victim is being treated and at other places. Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit has announced the setting up of a round-the-clock control room for women in distress and has promised a stringent law to curb sexual assault on women.

New Delhi:
Home Secretary RK Singh and Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar addressed the media on the developments in the Delhi gang-rape case.

Here are the highlights of what they said:

RK Singh, Home Secretary:

As we have indicated, we will chargesheet this case quickly.
After the chargesheet, we will have an expeditious trial.
Our request will be for a day to day trial and we will ask for maximum penalty.
Yesterday I had a meeting with Delhi Police and we discussed ways and means to crackdown on crime.
This is going to be a place where any goondagardi or dadagiri will be swiftly punished.
Large number of such buses which are contract carriages and were illegally plying have been impounded and will remain impounded.
We will auction them after court orders. Licences cancelled.
Licence ID to be displayed in buses, autos and taxis.
Any misbehaviour, complain to us and we will ensure the vehicle is impounded and it doesn't ply.
We will have plainclothes people on the streets, also on buses, and we hope to catch some people.
There is no reason for the Delhi Police to be defensive.
They have investigated and caught five of the six culprits.
If we think dispassionately, any case cracked in one or two days is brilliant work.
We have instructed the authorities about GPS (Global Positioning System). There will be GPS on all buses and all autos.. we have had a meeting with transport commissioner.
We raised with transport commissioner the issue of more buses on routes in the night.
From what I have looked at - I looked for the response of the PCR van.
I was told four minutes. Could they have reached earlier - that is a difficult question... four minutes is okay. Was investigation prompt and effective - yes it was.
So while we have not said no one will be held accountable, prima facie, on both counts, police cannot be faulted.
There is a separate strength sanctioned for VIP security.
There is no diversion of policemen from normal pool.
There are about 2700 people in X, Y, Z and Z+ categories.
I do not agree with people who say capital punishment is bad. But any change in law can be prospective and not retrospective.
Neeraj Kumar, Commissioner of Police, Delhi:

The fourth accused was tracked down to Rajasthan and brought to Delhi on December 18.
Last night we tracked down the fifth accused who is a juvenile so we cannot give details.
Police parties are on the trail of Akshay Thakur a resident of Aurangabad in Bihar, and we hope he will be tracked down soon.
We are hopeful that based on circumstantial evidence, oral evidence and forensic evidence we will be able to secure conviction.
We have added attempt to murder under Section 307 to the charges.
Police Control Room responded within four minutes.
The victims got timely medical aid dues to police response.
729 vehicles prosecuted on December 19 - 181 were buses. 464 vehicles - beat officers removed films.
All vehicles from other states with tinted glasses are being turned back - they will be allowed in Delhi only when tinted glasses are removed.
Crackdown on all charted buses trying to pass off as public carriages.
We are trying to implement a strict regime of permits - tied up with transport departments.
All drivers, cleaners need to be verified and need to have public service vehicle buses.
Anyone from other part of the country driving a public bus needs to be put through a fresh test.
The boy was disoriented - he gave us a vague description. One thing he was clear about is that it was a white bus and deluxe bus.
We started checking all white buses of that description.
We came across the video footage and we could piece together Yadav from the blurred footage.
We then tracked down one Yadav who led us to another person - and we then found the bus and the driver.

New Delhi:
As a young woman fights for her life in a Delhi hospital after being gang-raped on a Delhi bus, an incensed India is demanding justice and tougher punishment for rapists.  Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit talks exclusively to NDTV about a story that has shaken the whole country. 

Here are the highlights of her interview (these are not exact quotes):


This case is the most painful thing I have seen happening as Chief Minister or a citizen
This has touched the pinnacle of cruelty and insensitivity both by police and society
I do not like my city being described as rape capital but it is out in the open that it has become one
I have a daughter and and daughter-in-law. I am concerned about all girls in the city
We are putting up a 24 -hour cell where women can call in distress
Personally, I will go with you and say death penalty, flogging and shame them.  But thinking in terms of law, have murders stopped because of death penalty?
We called NGOs and police a few days back and decided to make a draft bill, a bill which acts as a deterrent. Once it is made we will send it to the Centre.
Unfortunately I do not have the police under me.
When doctors asked me if I would like to see her I said 'No, I don't have the courage.'
As a citizen of Delhi I feel very sad
This was inhuman, whether you have PCRs or not, it is unforgivable and unforgettable
Let us learn our lesson and do whatever is required to make it a safe city
I frankly did not have the courage to see her, I only met her parents and doctors.
It would not have been right to break down in front of her parents.
I am in touch with doctors. Not only her dignity and honour have been devastated...physically she is finished.
There is no chance of  her becoming alright. It's not just a rape...it's a murder in a way.
But her mind is right there...her heart is beating well.
I could see the father bent, the mother crying and doctors helpless.
The doctors told me in front of the parents that her intestines are all gone, so they know...
We must create an atmosphere in the city that it is a safe city. Why are other cities safe and Delhi not safe?
One reason I am told is that we have very porous borders...I have never discouraged migration, Delhi is a city of India...
We should increase policemen, we should decrease unnecessary security for VIPs
I would be the first one to get rid of my security. Delhi police gives security to people who they require it
It may be possible that it has become a status symbol
I am just an ordinary person like anyone else
Need to make it a secure city, then people won't care about VIP or non-VIP
To make women safe is too make them confident to ask for help
I do feel my hands are tied because Law and Order is not under me.
If police were under me I would have suspended a few policemen
The buck stops with the Police Commissioner and (Delhi's) Lt. Governor
I have not had a word with the LG , he is not here
They (the family)  are remarkable people
I assured them that we will take care of their son's education
We would be happy to send her anywhere in the world if it helps her survive
It is not the numbers which count. Why are other states safe and Delhi not safe? One reason is people come from other places and then go back
I am not saying people can't come here. It is the capital. People are most welcome.
We need to strive towards a situation where girls do not need to be escorted. Where people think of a girl , irrespective of her attire, as sacrosanct
I will not make false promises but I am striving  to make it better
No politician takes public transport. I have travelled in the metro, not regularly.
First time something has happened in a bus, that too a private one
I have not had complaints from metro but buses do have this....
What we are really discussing today is that they have the temerity to do this kind of crime
I would agree with ' Don't tell me what to wear, tell your son not to rape'

New Delhi:
The 23-year-old woman who was gang-raped on a moving bus is in stable condition but her platelet count has dropped further, doctors said today. Her case has enraged India, with protests being held every day to demand tougher punishment for rapists and more attention to women' safety by the government and the police. (Special Feature: Anger across India over gang-rape)

Doctors looking after the victim in the Intensive Care Unit of a Delhi hospital say they are also concerned about a possible infection developing in her liver.

The woman has undergone five surgeries since she was admitted to hospital late on Sunday night. Six men have been accused of battering her with an iron rod before raping her for an hour while the bus she had boarded with a friend kept circling South Delhi roads.

She is on a ventilator, so she scribbles messages for her doctors and family. Yesterday, she wrote ""They must be punished"" according to the Press Trust of India.  

Her case has enraged India; protests are being held every day all over the country to demand a swift trial in her case, as well as fast-track courts for other rape cases, and better policing on the streets of Delhi to prevent violence against women.  

Doctors yesterday said that they ""have never seen a case like this one"" and praised the victim's ""immense fighting spirit.""

New Delhi:
The Delhi Police has arrested the fifth person accused in the gang-rape of a 23-year-old medical student in a moving bus on Sunday. He was detained along with another man in western Uttar Pradesh last night. Four of the six accused in the case have already been arrested earlier this week.

Yesterday, the male friend of the victim, who was also thrashed repeatedly by the accused with an iron rod, identified one of the men in an identification parade. He reportedly took a minute to identify the accused out of 11 men who were brought in front of him.

Meanwhile, the 23-year-old girl who is battling for her life bravely after the brutal gang-rape, yesterday asked her family members, ""Have they been caught?""

Sources said the girl, who remained critical but stable, cannot speak as she has a tube in her mouth and communicates by writing on paper. ""She is aware that the media has taken up the case. The girl asked her family whether the accused have been caught,"" they said.

Doctors say their immediate and foremost concern was to get the young woman - whose almost entire intestine has been surgically removed - out of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and make her stable.

The friend of the medical student has been helping the police in its investigation. The young man was attacked by a group of drunk and leering men, who then raped his friend in a bus in Delhi on Sunday night. He shared his version of what happened in a Delhi court on Wednesday.

Four men, including the driver of the chartered bus, have been arrested in the case.

On Sunday night, the girl and her male friend, both from Uttar Pradesh, boarded a bus after watching a movie. The six men, who were already on board, began harassing the girl. He tried to stop them. They turned on him with an iron rod, striking his head over and over. She then tried to rescue him. Furious, the six men began hitting her. Then they took turns raping her while one of them kept the bus circling on South Delhi's roads.

One more accused has been arrested in connection with the Delhi gang rape case. He was detained along with another person in Uttar Pradesh last night. Meanwhile, the Delhi Police has submitted a status report in the Delhi High Court on its investigations into the brutal gang rape of a 23-year-old medical student in a moving bus on Sunday evening.
Here are the latest developments in the story:
The two men were detained last night from Badayun and Bareilley in Uttar Pradesh. The two have been identified as the cleaners of the bus, police sources said. The two men have been brought to Delhi. Four of the accused - the bus driver Ram Singh, his brother, Mukesh, Vinay, a gym assistant and Pawan or Kalu, a fruitseller - had been arrested earlier in the week.
Mukesh was identified yesterday by the victim's male friend, who was with her when the incident happened.

(Read) The government has set up a panel of five top doctors who will monitor the treatment of the young victim. They will ensure that she gets the best possible medical attention. The young woman, who is conscious and alert, has been communicating with her family by writing. Yesterday, she asked if her assailants had been caught. (Read: 'Have they been caught?', gang-rape survivor reportedly asked)
Meanwhile, the Delhi Police, which is looking at recording the victim's statement, has been asked to prepare a written questionnaire, which the latter can respond to either in writing or through gestures. She has asked for her mother to be present during that time.
After angry protests in Delhi, Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit has said it is time to ""turn outrage into action."" She has announced the setting up of a round-the-clock control room for women in distress and has promised a stringent law to curb sexual assault on women. (Read: Sheila Dikshit's steps to make Delhi safer for women) Additional Solicitor General Indira Jaisingh has been asked to prepare a draft bill.
The Supreme Court Bar Association has also submitted a memorandum to the office of the Chief Justice of India, seeking the top court's intervention in amending the laws against rape and sexual harassment.
The High Court had, on Wednesday, rapped the city police on its knuckles for its inability to check the crime that went undetected. The bus, which had tinted windows, passed through several police checkpoints without being stopped or searched, as the victim and her friend were subjected to unimaginable horror. The court had also asked Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Sharma to file a report on the probe within 48 hours.
The Delhi Police have collected forensic evidence from the bus used for the gang-rape. Sources say that after stripping the victim and her friend and throwing them semi-naked from the bus, the alleged rapists took it to a secluded spot and washed it to delete blood stains and traces of semen. They burnt the couple's clothes but their shoes and phones were not destroyed and have been recovered by the police.
The bus was owned by a private operator named Dinesh Yadav, who had leased six vehicles to a school. The police will file a case against Mr Yadav since the bus was not parked with him, but was in the custody of the driver, Ram Singh, who is among those arrested. Police say the 33-year-old driver was often drunk. For 10 months, he was assigned to drive the bus. (Read: Bus driver was often drunk, picked fights)
On Wednesday, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde met with senior Delhi policemen to plan better safety for women in Delhi. The police are identifying areas near malls, and markets and will increase patrolling along these routes at night. All vehicles with tinted windows will be impounded. Bus operators have been ordered to post photos of drivers on vehicles. Private buses need to be parked at their owners' premises; owners will be responsible for the vehicles at all times.

New Delhi:
As protests erupted over the gang rape of a 23-year-old, the Delhi government announced a draft of measures including setting up of a round-the-clock control room for women in distress and proposing a stringent law to check crime against them.

Briefing about the measures, Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said the government plans to bring a stringent law to curb sexual assault on women and requested Additional Solicitor General Indira Jaisingh to prepare a draft bill.

Mrs Dikshit, who has also come under attack following the ghastly assault on the girl in Delhi on Sunday, said all stakeholders would be consulted before finalising the proposed legislation.

""I think it will go a long way in containing crime against women. We will consult all stakeholders before finalising the draft law,"" she said..

The measures were finalised by the city government based on suggestion put forth by representatives of Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) and various other organisations at a meeting called by Mrs Dikshit on Wednesday which was attended by top brass of the Delhi Police including its commissioner Neeraj Kumar.

Vice Chancellor of Delhi University Dinesh Singh, Planning Commission member Syeeda Hamid, Chairperson-designate of FICCI Naina Kidwai and former NCW chairperson Mohini Giri were also present at the meeting.

Mrs Dikshit said the round-the-clock control room for women in distress will function from her office at Delhi Secretariat and will have dedicated phone number. The control room will be commissioned within next 10 days.

The Chief Minister said a massive public awareness campaign will be launched soon on safeguarding the dignity and safety of women in the city. DCW will act as a nodal agency for the campaign in which citizen groups, RWAs, corporate houses and Mahila Panchayats would be involved.

Angry protesters, mostly students, on Thursday blocked the Jammu-Pathankote national highway demanding capital punishment for the accused involved in the gang-rape of a young woman in New Delhi.

New Delhi:
The Delhi High Court today had scathing feedback for the Delhi Police Commissioner. ""People are losing faith in the police and judiciary. What was the police doing before this incident?"" the court asked.

Taking suo motu cognisance of the shocking case of the gang-rape of a 23-year-old girl in a moving bus on Sunday, it has asked for a report in two days on the investigation.

The court said ""This incident is of great concern for all the citizens of the capital city as it relates to the safety particularly of women and girl children in Delhi.""

The judges also pointed out that the bus involved in the gang-rape went through five police check-points ""and nobody stopped it"".

""We are at loss to understand as to how the bus could evade surveillance for 40 minutes,"" a bench headed by Chief Justice D Murugesan said.

The court asked the counsel for the Delhi Police to explain how the Supreme Court ban on vehicles with tinted windows had not been implemented so far. ""The Police Commissioner shall also state the steps taken to remove the tinted glasses from vehicles, including public transport,"" the court said.

The Delhi government informed the court that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been set up to investigate the crime  and it will be headed by Deputy Commissioner of Police Chhaya Sharma

The bench said that the probe must be ""of high standards"" and the final charge sheet ""has to be"" filed only after its perusal by this court. ""We would be issuing necessary directions time to time in this court. This court will also issue the guidelines after taking note of the contentions of all concerned,"" it said.

The court also asked the Director of central forensic laboratories to accord primacy to the investigation in the present case.

The Delhi High court has also sanctioned five fast-track courts to deal with rape cases. However, Justice Murugesan observed today that unless investigations were conducted properly and witnesses produced during trials, even fast-track courts would not serve any purpose. (Read)

Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit had yesterday urged the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court to take ""urgent"" action in making the fast-track courts functional. She said the city government had already approved setting up of the fast-track courts to deal with the cases of sexual assault on women and to provide speedy justice and conviction of the guilty.

The two judge bench enquired about victim's medical condition and asked the Delhi Government to consider shifting her to a super specialty hospital. ""We direct the Delhi Government to shift, if possible, the victim to a super specialty hospital. If it is not possible to shift her, then the experts be asked to visit her,"" Justice Murugesan said and posted the matter for hearing on Friday.

Taking suo motu cognisance of the shocking case of the gang-rape of a 23-year-old girl in a moving bus on Sunday, the Delhi High Court today asked the Police Commissioner to a file status report on the case within two days.

The court also approved the setting up of five fast-track courts for tackling rape cases in the city.

Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit had yesterday urged the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court to take ""urgent"" action in making the fast-track courts functional.

She said the city government had already approved setting up of the fast-track courts to deal with the cases of sexual assault on women and to provide speedy justice and conviction of the guilty. Ms Dikshit said the courts have not been made functional despite the Delhi government conveying the High Court about its approval to the proposal in October.

Referring to the gang rape and brutal assault on the girl on Sunday evening, Ms Dikshit suggested to Justice Murugesan that bail should not be given to those involved in heinous crimes against women. ""This would additionally act as a strong deterrent,"" she added.

The Chief Minister said her government would extend any possible support required in making the courts functional at the earliest.

The girl, a paramedical student, was raped and brutally assaulted before being thrown out of the moving vehicle with her male friend.

""This is a shocking incident and we will take all necessary action to ensure that such incidents do not recur in future. At the same time we need to have deterrent punishment to the perpetrators of such crime against women,"" Ms Dikshit said.

Ram Singh, the driver who had easy access to the bus used to rape a woman in Delhi on Sunday night, had been involved in a major accident in 2009 in which his arms were seriously injured, said police sources today.

Ram Singh is among six men accused of rape and attempt to murder. The woman they assaulted repeatedly and with brute force is fighting for her life in a Delhi hospital.

On weekdays, Ram Singh, employed by a private bus operator named Yadav Travels in Noida, would drive children to and from a private school in Saket.

On Sunday night, he allowed his brother, Mukesh, to take the wheel. The bus, which had tinted windows, not allowed in Delhi, was off-duty; the brothers and four other men decided to go on ""a joyride,"" according to Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar.

They pulled over at a bus stop and picked up a carpenter. He paid Rs 10 for his ticket. On board, he was robbed of Rs 8,000 and then dropped near the IIT campus in South Delhi.

Half an hour later, the men on the bus noticed a young couple on the road. They pulled over. Assuming that this was one of the many privately-operated buses that are treated like public transport in Delhi, the couple bought Rs 10 tickets and boarded.

The men on the bus then began harassing the woman passenger. Why was she out at night with a man, they asked. It was 9.30 pm.

Her friend tried to intervene. The men retaliated by hitting him with an iron rod. The woman then tried to stop them. They turned on her. She was ""punched repeatedly in the stomach,"" said the Delhi Police Commissioner before the men took turns raping her. The bus kept moving.

At 11 pm, the couple was stripped and thrown onto the road. Ram Singh went to a secluded spot and washed the bus, intent on cleansing blood stains and any semen that could later link the vehicle to the heinous attack.

CCTV footage from Delhi's National Highway 8 showed the bus had ""Yadav"" painted outside. As the police asked the public for information, Dinesh Yadav, the owner of Ram Singh's bus, approached the police.

Ram Singh was among the four men arrested yesterday. Two more accused of the rape are missing.

Ram Singh has refused to take part in an identification parade.

New Delhi:
The Delhi Police has added the charge of attempt to murder against the accused in the gang-rape of a medical student in the Capital on Sunday. Last night, the police added three fresh charges against the accused. They include destruction of evidence and robbery.

The main accused in the gang-rape, bus driver Ram Singh, had yesterday refused to undergo a test identification parade, which now forces the police to base its case against him and his co-accused on forensic evidence.

Ram Singh, 30, was produced in a local court yesterday and was remanded to five days in police custody. He was brought to a jam-packed courtroom with his face covered. The bus driver is among four men arrested by the police; two of the accused are on the run.   

A test identification parade is a procedure in which the alleged offender is brought before witnesses and victims for identification. It could have been conducted as soon as the victim's male friend - who was with her on Sunday evening and was also beaten up brutally by the six men who allegedly raped the student - was pronounced medically fit to identify the accused. But Ram Singh is allowed by law to refuse such a parade. 

The police sought Ram Singh's custody in court as they said they needed to interrogate him to trace the two men yet to be arrested.

Apart from trying to trace the clothes the accused were wearing that day for forensic evidence, the police also want to recover the mobile phones and ATM cards of the victim and her male friend, which the assailants allegedly took away with them.

The police said that while in their custody, Ram Singh will be taken to Rajasthan, Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh to help arrest the two men absconding.

Ram Singh was the first to be arrested in the case on Monday evening. The three others arrested are expected to be produced in court today.   

On Sunday evening, police said, Ram Singh, his brother Mukesh and four other friends took the chartered bus he drove as a school bus, for a ""joy ride"".

They spotted the student and her friend at the Munirka bus stop in south Delhi and called out to them saying the bus was headed to Dwarka, where the woman lives, the police said.

Inside the bus they reportedly first taunted the two for being out together in the night and then assaulted them. When the woman fought back, police sources say, the six men ""decided to teach her a lesson."" They dragged her to the back of the moving bus and repeatedly raped her and punched her in the stomach. 

They also beat her friend with an iron rod. After almost an hour of the torture, they allegedly threw the two out of the bus, stripped of much of their clothing, on a flyover.

They were found unconscious there and were taken to hospital by the police, where the woman has undergone multiple surgeries and is now on ventilator support with what doctors have described as ""irreparable damage"" to her abdomen and intestines.

Amid national anger over the gang-rape of a medical student in Delhi in a moving bus, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde outlined for parliament how the government plans to increase the safety of women in the capital

The minister said a new committee, headed by the Home Secretary, will evaluate what needs to change, based partly on suggestions made in parliament today by members of the opposition.

He also said that routes used often by women at night are being identified and will be patrolled at night by police vans and cops on motorcycles.   

Call centres have been ordered by the police to ensure that women workers being dropped home after late shifts are escorted to their door-step.  

Mr Shinde also said that a proposal will be made to fast-track the trial in Sunday night's case with daily hearings to ensure that justice is delivered quickly.  

In parliament today, upset members of the opposition attacked the government. Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj said Sunday night's heinous attack proves that rapists must be given the death penalty.

The woman attacked on Sunday night is conscious now in hospital but remains in critical condition, her doctors said, adding that she has serious injuries in her intestines and private parts.

On Sunday at 9.30 pm, the 23-year-old and her friend boarded a bus in South Delhi after watching a movie.  For nearly an hour, the woman was gang-raped by six people.  Four of those men have been arrested; two have yet to be tracked down, Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar said today.

The bus that was used was run by a private operator and was used by two private schools.  On Sunday night, the driver and his friends ""were on a joyride"",  the commissioner said, when they came across the couple at a bus stop.

The men on the bus taunted the woman for being out at night with a man.  When he tried to protect her, they attacked him with an iron rod.  The medical student tried to help him, but was beaten and then gang-raped.  The couple was thrown, semi-naked,  from the bus at about 11 pm.

The police have arrested three prime accused in the shocking case of a medical student being gang-raped and assaulted in a bus in Delhi on Sunday. Those arrested include the driver of the bus and his brother.

Three others have been detained. According to the police, along with the driver of the bus, Ram Singh, and his brother, four more men were involved in the crime. The police have also recovered the iron rod, which was used to assault the victim and her friend.

On Sunday, the 23-year-old medical student and her male friend finished watching a movie in Saket in South Delhi. At about 10 pm, they boarded a bus from Munirka in south Delhi. The six men, who were already on the chartered bus, run by a private operator, saw the young girl and began harassing and taunting her for being out with a man late in the night.

What happened next is not clear yet before an unimaginable 45 minutes. The woman was then gang-raped and beaten repeatedly with an iron rod. Her companion, who tried to intervene and protect her, was also attacked.

A little after 11 pm, the Police Control Room received a phone call from a passer-by, informing them about the semi-naked couple, lying unconscious on a flyover. The police then collected the young couple and rushed them to a hospital.

More than 24 hours later, the woman is struggling for her life. After going through multiple operations, she is currently on a ventilator.

The police sources say the iron rod used on her caused irreparable damage to her abdomen. ""Doctors say she is very critical. The abdomen and the intestine are not in the right place. This is an absolutely abominable act and I condemn it,"" said Kiran Walia, Women and Child Development Minister, Delhi.

Her friend was treated for head injuries and is reportedly in critical condition.

The bus used was tracked down to the suburb of Noida, and was reportedly used by private schools. Though last night, police believe that Ram Singh and others were moonlighting, hoping to make an extra buck. They were all drinking before the incident, according to the police.

Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said that the permit of the bus has been cancelled by the transport department and necessary action would be taken to ensure such incidents don't happen in the future.

""I have been told by transport department that their licence has been cancelled. We will take all the necessary measures to ensure that such incidents don't happen,"" she said.

The Class ten student claimed that the incident took place on August 14 and one of the accused was her brother's friend, who is a driver.

According to her, the driver offered her lift and made her drink soft drinks laced with sedatives. When she regained consciousness, she claimed that she found herself in a room where the driver's friend and a woman were present. The driver's friend filmed the crime and circulated it in the locality.

They allegedly threatened her that they will upload the clip on internet if she complained to police. The woman dropped her at her home later. A medical examination confirmed rape.

New Delhi:
The ""contradictory versions"" of the parents of a girl regarding her age has led to acquittal of a man in a kidnapping-cum-rape case by a Delhi court. The court said the girl's actual age was ""deliberately withheld"".

The court noted the parents of the girl, who were the ""best evidence"" to depose regarding her actual age, had not given satisfactory reply during the trial.

The girl had mentioned her age as 17 years in her statement recorded in 2007 and 2009 respectively.

It also said the certificate, issued in the girl's name by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi mentioning her date of birth as July 19, 1992, was also ""disowned"" by her parents.

""The birth certificate (of MCD) was not corroborated at all by the best evidence on the record i.e. the deposition of the parents of the girl, who appeared and almost disowned the said certificate in the said answers given by them in their respective cross examination,"" Additional Sessions Judge Rakesh Tewari said.

The court acquitted Manoj, a resident of Nangloi here, who was accused of kidnapping and raping the girl on September 8, 2007.

According to the police, on September 8, 2007, the girl's father had told them his daughter was missing and Manoj, who was their neighbour, was also found missing.

During investigation, the girl was found and her statement was recorded before a magistrate. In her statement, the girl claimed to have gone on her own to Manoj and they had gone to Haridwar.

She said the two got married in Haridwar at a temple and remained there for two days. She said Manoj was innocent and she was responsible for her actions.

During the trial, Manoj had also pleaded innocence.

New Delhi:
A 22-year-old youth has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Delhi court for raping a 77-year-old woman in the Capital. The court observed that the case was a glaring example of how ""no woman is safe, whatever her age"".

Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sanjeev Kumar refused to show any leniency to Bhola Aadivasi, a rickshaw puller from Madhya Pradesh convicted for raping an elderly woman passenger twice his mother's age on March 11, last year.

""This conduct of the convict sends shock waves through countless women passengers, who avail public transport,"" the ASJ said, adding, ""This case is a glaring example that no woman is safe, whatever her age. In this case, the prosecutrix (victim) is a lady of 77 years. The convict is just 22 years old. Yet this has not deterred the convict from raping a hapless old woman.""

The court has also convicted Bhola with criminal intimidation, injury and poisoning the victim. The court said that the lady trusted the rickshaw puller implicitly and that he had ""different intentions"".  He gagged her, knocked  her unconscious and raped her in a secluded area.

The act of the convict was so ""ghastly and inhuman"", said the judge, that it cannot be condoned and a lighter sentence cannot be handed.

The ASJ said that this case should set a precedent for crimes against women. ""Bhola's severe sentence has been rightfully passed. The court's verdict should act as a deterrent to those wishing to commit heinous crimes against women.""

Noida:
Police handling of an alleged case of gangrape, that of a minor in Noida close to the national capital, has caused much outrage. The 17-year-old Class X student was allegedly raped by five men in a car at midnight last week, and the Noida police compounded the child's trauma by revealing her identity. Not just that, a senior police officer suggested that the victim had accompanied the accused willingly and ""drank vodka with them.""

Under pressure from several quarters, among them Women and Child Welfare Minister Krishna Tirath, the UP administration has said it will take action against Noida Superintendent of Police Ananth Dev Tiwari.

The victim has said in a police FIR that she knew one of the accused. She met him and the four others at a birthday party on Saturday. She also said that she was forced to drink. Then, the five men, while dropping her back, close to midnight, allegedly took her to a deserted area and then took turns to rape the Class X student.

The police have arrested all the five men that the girl has accused of rape. It was while briefing the press about the incident and their investigations on Sunday that the Noida police printed the victim's name for circulation and publish and SP Ananth Dev Tiwari, said publically, ""She had gone there willingly... She was not lured into it... They drank vodka.""

This is in direct contravention of Supreme Court directions. The court has observed that no judgement in rape cases should name the victim, and there are court directions which say that the victim's statement should be taken at face value till a trial proves otherwise.

A livid National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has slammed the police for the insensitive way in which the case has been handled. Minister Krishna Tirath said she had written to the UP Chief Secretary and the Uttar Pradesh administration has swung into damage control mode. Additional Director-General of Police, law and order, Subesh Kumar said later in the day, ""I have spoken to IG Meerut range and asked him to give a detailed report. We need to look into what circumstances these remarks were made under."" He admitted that ""looking at the sensitivity, as a matter of principle we don't reveal the identity of the victim.""

The IG Meerut, Rajeev Krishna, too said the law was clear on this. ""According to the Supreme Court laws, which are very clear, one cannot disclose the name of the victim or their family. In this case, if this law hasn't been followed, we will take strict action. I have asked for a report from the SSP of Gautam Budh Nagar. We will investigate and take action after looking into all the facts,"" he said.

Kolkata:
Mamata Banerjee has been caught in a controversy of her own making in West Bengal over a rape that left Kolkata cold. The city is usually considered safe for women, especially when compared to other metros like Delhi or Mumbai. Remarkably, Ms Banerjee had dismissed first reports of the case as an attempt to defame her government. Here are 10 big facts on the case:

The chief minister met this morning with the city's senior-most police officials, reportedly to discuss their progress in investigations. 

Three men were arrested on Saturday; two others are missing.

At a rally in Kolkata yesterday, the CPM, which was defeated by Ms Banerjee in elections last year, targeted the chief minister for her insensitive handling of the case.

On the night of February 5, the victim was at a pub at Kolkata's famous Park Street. A man who befriended her at the pub offered her a ride home in his Honda City. When she climbed in, there were two men in the car. But soon, another three entered the vehicle. She was raped at gunpoint. 

The victim filed her police case a few days later, on February 9. She says she had been traumatised by the event and needed some time to recover before going to the police with her story.

The victim, who is 37-years-old, alleges that the police mocked her when she tried to get a case registered. Officers allegedly used the fact that she had been at a pub to judge her character.

The media began reporting on the story last week. As the police announced that it was searching for the rapists, the Chief Minister said the case had been fabricated to malign the government, triggering a debate about her perceived insensitivity.

The investigation was complicated by the fact that the men involved assumed other people's names when introducing themselves to the victim. When the police searched Facebook for their photos, the images did not match the men who the victim had met.  

Footage from security cameras installed near the pub that the woman visited helped the police identify the men who drove away with her.

Medical tests on the victim were conducted on February 14. Sources say that the reports do not confirm rape, but doctors attribute this to the delay between her assault and her medical check-up.

New Delhi:
The Delhi Police today filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Delhi High Court's acquittal of suspended IPS officer RK Sharma in the Shivani Bhatnagar murder case.

The Delhi High Court in October acquitted Mr Sharma and two others in the 1999 murder of journalist Shivani Bhatnagar. It, however, upheld the conviction and life sentence of the fourth accused, Pradeep Sharma, who had killed the scribe.

The senior police officer, who at one time worked in the Prime Minister's Office, was acquitted by the High Court after he appealed against a Delhi court's March 2008 verdict that found him and three others guilty of murdering Shivani Bhatnagar.

The judge in the lower court held that Mr Sharma hired hitmen to murder Shivani Bhatnagar because he was worried that she would go public with details of their relationship. The same judge said that the former police officer did not deserve the death penalty because of his ""excellent"" service record.

The court had sentenced Mr Sharma, Pradeep Sharma, Bhagwan Sharma and Satya Prakash to life imprisonment. In the High Court, Mr Sharma's lawyer had argued that the evidence against him was largely circumstantial, and had been tampered with by the Delhi Police to implicate him. The police, on the other hand, contended that Mr Sharma used his senior position to influence witnesses and to try and extricate himself from the case.

Shivani Bhatnagar, a senior journalist with the newspaper The Indian Express, was murdered in her east Delhi apartment on January 23, 1999. Her two-month-old son was with her when she was killed. She had reportedly met Mr Sharma while covering the Prime Minister's Office.

Mr Sharma had surrendered to the police in September 2002.

New Delhi:
Despite several new initiatives by Delhi Police to make the capital safer for women, the year 2011 saw a significant increase in the number of rape and molestation cases over the previous year. Shockingly, almost 98 per cent of the offenders were either related or known to the victims.

A total of 568 rape cases were reported in 2011 as against 507 in 2010. However, the incidence of rape per lakh population has shown a steady decline in Delhi, coming down from 4.42 per lakh in 2005 to 3.39 per lakh in 2011.

Addressing the Delhi Police Annual Press Conference here, Commissioner B K Gupta said, in over 550 of the 568 rape cases reported in 2011, the offenders were found to be known to the victims.

""Thus it is seen that these are opportunistic crimes committed in private spaces,"" Commissioner Gupta said.

He said only 2 per cent of rapes in 2011 were committed by strangers as compared to almost  4 per cent  in 2010.

There has also been an increase in cases of molestation of women in 2011 with 653 cases being reported as against 601 in 2010, he said.

To reduce the crime against women and make the city Delhi safer, Gupta said, the Delhi Police would deploy more women personnel on duty and every police station will have a woman personnel to interact with complainants.

He said, women-centric police stations have been established in north and south campuses of the Delhi University while the five districts in the capital have women Deputy Commissioners of Police and Additional Deputy Commissioners of Police. He also said, 460 women constables have been imparted commando training in 2011 with 25 being imparted advanced training by the CRPF.

Gupta said orders have been issued to BPOs and other offices to take steps for safety and security of women while PCR vans have been directed to help stranded women, and surprise checks are being conducted in bus stops, buses, markets and cinema halls.

According to the Commissioner, 63 programmes of self-defence training for women were launched in 2011 in various schools and colleges covering 6,730 students.

He said the Delhi Police has also taken a number of initiatives to protect senior citizens in the capital. A senior citizen cell has been functioning in the Police Headquarters under Crime Branch where such people can register their names.

""The beat staff regularly visits them,"" he said.

New Delhi:
It's not just the increasing number of crimes against women that is raising concerns in the Capital. Often the seemingly callous attitude of the cops adds to a victim's woes. A 23-year-old woman was allegedly kidnapped after being drugged from KG Marg area by her stalker who took her to Western UP in a car, seeking revenge for an 'insult'. The girl was dumped by the accused after being raped. The victim has filed an FIR in this respect with New Delhi district police while the case is being processed by crime against women cell. However, she and her family have blamed the police for making them run from pillar to post initially.

Jilted lover
A senior police official on the condition of anonymity said that the victim, Shreya (name changed on request) lives in KG Marg area with her parents. She has alleged that she was kidnapped last week by her neighbour Akhilesh who lives in a rented accommodation. ""Akhilesh had proposed to me many time times, but each time I spurned his advances. He had threatened me. Akhilesh lives in the house of a person named Raju.

I had complained against Akhilesh to Raju many times but he did not rectify himself. Akhilesh then hatched a conspiracy along with Raju and his wife Geeta to kidnap me. Geeta called me on the pretext of some work. I was offered tea by her. She had laced the drink with sedatives. After having it I fell unconscious. When I woke up I found myself in a car,"" she told the police.

The source added that the car was driven by a man who was a relative of Akhilesh. When the victim asked them where they were taking her, the driver fished out a knife and threatened her with dire consequences and asked not to utter a word. Shreya also told the police that she was taken to Etah city in UP where she was held hostage in a room.

Akhilesh was there and he raped her many times. Meanwhile her parents had started a search for her. When the accused persons came to know about this Akhilesh dumped her outside a temple in UP and ran away. She was brought back to the Capital by her parents. She narrated the whole incident to her family after which they decided to approach the police. They claim, initially the police were not ready to lodge an FIR but finally they relented. A police official said that the case was lodged at Tilak Marg police station and it is being probed by the crime against woman cell. ""The case is being investigated,"" said the police.

Former banker jailed for rape
A former chief manager of Allahabad Bank was jailed for seven years by a Delhi court on August 29 for raping his friend's wife two years ago. The judge imposed the minimum jail term, prescribed for a rape convict, on 51-year-old former chief manager of the bank's branch at Parliament Street after the victim and her husband told the court that they do not want the offender's family to suffer for his fault. The victim and her husband also told the court that convict Raghuvinder Harna is ready to publicly apologise to the victim and accordingly they were intending to reach an out-of-court settlement on the issue and appeal to the high court for quashing of the case. ""Under the given circumstances, when the parties are in a process of out-of-court settlement after the convict (bank manager) publicly apologises in front of their senior members of both the families, I, hereby, award rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years to the convict,"" the judge said.

A breakthrough, as the Delhi Police arrest robbers Shamshad and Usman for raping a 30-year-old call-centre employee last Wednesday.

A rape, that has provoked a huge outrage in the capital.

One of the five suspects, Usman, had been charged with another gangrape in Faridabad, 3 years ago. He was also charged with assualting a police team in Sarai Rohilla in Delhi last year.

Others have had criminal records and have been charged with anumber of crimes ranging from petty theft to cow slaughter.

''The victim's car was followed by the five men. And seeing that the girls got off at Ring Road, they pulled the victim into the tempo. The men were drunk and committed the crime on the spur of the moment,"" said BK Gupta, the Delhi Police Commissioner.  

The victim had given a detailed description of the vehicle.

Using that, the police had scanned 6,000 tempos in the capital and around it.

The Delhi Police, after eight days of extensive search got a breakthrough in the case through a tip off from Mewat.

It was a call about a tempo matching the description.  The police raided the various dens in Haryana's Mewat region and arrested the men.

Police are yet to make any headway in identifying or arresting the four men who allegedly abducted and raped a call centre employee hailing from Mizoram in the national capital.

The 30-year-old woman was walking towards her home in Moti Village in south Delhi early yesterday morning along with one of her colleagues when the men forced her into a vehicle and took turns to rape her.

She was later dumped in Mongolpuri after which she approached police.

""No arrests have been made. We are in the process of identifying the accused,"" a senior police official said. A case of rape and abduction has been registered and investigations are on.

""She is traumatised. A NGO has been approached for counselling,"" the official said.

The victim, who works in a Gurgaon BPO, had come to the capital four years ago and was staying with her sister in a rented accommodation in Moti Village near Dhaula Kuan.

The North-East Helpline, an NGO which works for the welfare of people from the North-East, demanded that a separate helpline should be set up by police with an officer preferably from the region heading it.

NE Helpline spokesperson Madhu Chandra said they have spoken to senior officials in Home Ministry and Delhi Police.
""We are also demanding that night patrolling should be enhanced in areas like Mohammedpur, Nanakpura, New Friends Colony, North Delhi campus, Nehru Basti and Gandhi Basti where people from the North-East are staying,"" he said.

The NE Helpline alleged that call-centre cabs drop women on main roads late at night and they have to walk home.

""We strongly believe most of these women will be protected if Delhi Police enhances night patrolling,"" Chandra said.

Police on its part said they have set up a cell under a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) in each district to deal with the problems faced by people from the north-east.

A senior police official said they had earlier issued instructions to call centres to ensure that women are dropped near their house and not on roads.

""There was a meeting with BPOs recently. We have asked them to ensure that a security guard also accompany them in the vehicles,"" the official said.

The official said the companies were also asked to get the police verification of cab drivers and security guards who were accompanying staff in the vehicles.

""Also, the Police Commissioner has asked us to step up PCR patrolling during the night to ensure that working women were safe,"" the official said.

New Delhi, Koderma:
In a new twist in the case of Nirupama Pathak, the young journalist who was found dead at her parent's home in Koderma, the police have booked the girl's boyfriend Priyabhanshu for abetment to suicide and have questioned him. Priyabhanshu now has to fight to keep himself out of jail.

This after Nirupama's parents approached the Koderma court to file a case against him.

This morning the court, ordered the Jharkhand police to charge Priyabhanshu Ranjan with rape, cheating and abetment of suicide of Nirupama, the woman Priyabhanshu Ranjan wanted to marry.

It's a bizarre turn of events since just five days back the police had ruled out the possibility of suicide and arrested Nirupama Pathak's mother on charges of murder.

The case was registered on the basis of the postmortem report that said Nirupama died of smothering and her body was hung after she died.

Nirupama was then believed to have been killed for defying her family and wanting to marry a boy outside her caste.

""There are no external injury marks on her which means that she was probably pinned down by a few people and then smothered,"" said P Mohan, Civil Surgeon, Koderma.

Nirupama's mother Sudha Pathak is still in custody and last night the police seized Priyabhanshu's mobile and laptop and Nirupama's diary from her flat in Delhi, sources say they wanted a sample of handwriting to match it with the suicide note.

So, is the police going back on their claim that Nirupama was murdered by her own family.

""I am scared for my life,"" says Priyabhanshu.

How did Nirupama die, was it a cold blooded murder or did she kill herself? After so many twists and turns the Jharkhand police is refusing to confirm anything on record.

The Delhi High Court on Monday sentenced the prime convict in the 2002 Maulana Azad Medical College student rape case to life imprisonment.

Observing that the accused, Rahul, had acted ""not only as a beast but even acted savage,"" a bench headed by Justice Pradeep Nandrajog upheld the trial court verdict which had sentenced him to life imprisonment.

The court, however, acquitted the other convict Amit on charges of rape and directed the police to release him as he had already undergone seven years of imprisonment.

The convicts - Rahul and his accomplice Amit - were held guilty of raping a medical student by a trial court in January 2005.

The victim, a fourth-year student of the Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC), was raped at knife point on the terrace of the Mughal monument 'Khooni Darwaza' in central Delhi on November 15, 2002.

The trial court had awarded Rahul and Amit life imprisonment and acquitted two other accused, Ashok, of the charge of harbouring the accused, and Mohan Lal, of the charge of dishonestly receiving stolen property from the accused.

The Delhi police had in 2003 filed a chargesheet against four persons - Rahul, Amit, Mohan Lal and Ashok - in the case which had hogged headlines.

A Delhi court on Thursday awarded rigorous imprisonment of 14 years to the lone arrested accused convicted in the sensational Dhaula Kuan gangrape case in which a Delhi University student was ravished in a moving car in 2005.

""The scar of rape always remains in the mind of the victim and cannot be overcome throughout her life,"" Additional Sessions Judge Neeraj Kumar Gupta said.

Terming the act of convict Ajit Singh Katiyar as ""beastly"", the court also slapped a fine of Rs 20,000 on him after finding him guilty of gangrape, abduction, criminal intimidation, administering intoxicant and group liability.

Earlier, the public prosecutor, arguing on quantum of sentence, sought maximum punishment for the convict, saying ""the victim was raped six times in a moving car in her over two-hour-long illegal detention.""

Citing various apex court judgements, he said no leniency should be granted to such sexual offender.

Defence counsel Manoj Sharma, however, sought lenient sentence for his client on the ground that he belongs to a poor family background and had to look after his old and ailing parents.

A city court on Tuesday convicted the lone arrested accused in the sensational Dhaula Kuan gangrape case in which a Delhi University student was abducted and raped in a moving car here.

Additional Sessions Judge Neeraj Kumar Gupta held Ajit Singh Katiyar guilty under various sections of the IPC dealing with abduction, rape and criminal intimidation.

The court fixed December 10 for arguments on the quantum of sentence. The convict may face a maximum punishment of rigorous life imprisonment.

The court had on Monday deferred till today its verdict in the case in which a 20-year-old Delhi University girl was abducted and gangraped in a moving car four years ago.

Earlier on November 30 too, the court had deferred the pronouncement of verdict.

The Delhi University student, hailing from Mizoram, was abducted at around 2.15 am on May 8, 2005 while she was walking back home after buying food from a roadside eatery along with a friend and was raped by four accused in a moving car near Dhaula Kuan in South Delhi, the prosecution had said in its argument.

Her friend, somehow, managed to escape from the spot.

The victim was later dumped near a Gurudwara in the area.

Police, however, could arrest only one of the accused -- Ajit Singh Katiyar. The other three accused -- Danda, Jat and Tappe -- have evaded arrest and were declared proclaimed offenders during the trial.

Two suspended members of the elite President's Body Guards (PBG) were awarded rigorous life imprisonment by a Delhi court on Saturday in connection with the gangrape of a 17-year-old Delhi University student in the city's Buddha Jayanti Park in 2003.
Harpreet Singh and Satyender Singh, who were held guilty on the charge of gangrape, were awarded the maximum punishment of life imprisonment by Additional Sessions Judge S K Sarvaria.
The other two members of the prestigious Guards -- Kuldeep Singh and Manish Kumar -- were sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment. They were absolved of the charge of gangrape, but convicted for robbery, kidnapping and helping their colleagues.
The crime was committed when the Delhi University student, along with her boyfriend Ashish, had gone to Buddha Jayanti park in the backyard of the Presidential Palace complex on October 6, 2003, to watch a programme of the Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama.
She was detained and robbed by the four convicts before being raped by Harpreet and Satyender while the other two kept watch.
The pronouncement of the punishment came five days after the four bodyguards were found guilty.
