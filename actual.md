Frontend: Mobile-optimized web app instead of full React Native

Django templates + Bootstrap for rapid development
Progressive Web App features for mobile experience


Maps: MapBox JS or Google Maps JS API
Deployment: Local demo or simple Heroku/PythonAnywhere deployment

Hackathon Success Strategy

Focus on storytelling - Show the problem, your solution, and potential impact
Create a compelling demo flow - Script a specific user journey that shows off key features
Acknowledge future development - Be honest about limitations but show vision for full implementation
Prepare for technical questions - Be ready to explain your architecture choices
